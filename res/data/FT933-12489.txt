THREE foreign companies yesterday applied to delist from the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's foreign section. The move is scheduled for October 30.
The three are Warner-Lambert and Bellsouth of the US, and Dixons of the UK.
They will take the number of delistings since 1992 to 13, including General
Motors of the US, Philips of the Netherlands and Royal Bank of Canada.
The three companies said high costs and administrative burdens were the main
reason for ending their Tokyo presence.
The fall in trading activity has also become a concern for foreign
companies, which have primarily listed in Tokyo to enhance their
international profile.
Shares traded in Tokyo peaked in 1987 with a daily average of 2.76m shares
traded: daily volume fell to some 200,000 shares this year.
Tokyo trading in foreign stocks started in 1973. The latest delistings will
reduce the number of listed companies to 111, down from a peak of 127 in
late 1991.
