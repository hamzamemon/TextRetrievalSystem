THE LOCAL Government Commission will today publish its final recommendations
for reorganising local authorities in Cleveland, Durham and Derbyshire in a
move that is likely to spark a clash with Mr John Gummer, environment
secretary.
The commission is expected to recommend maintenance of the two-tier
structure in Durham and much of Derbyshire, rejecting the government's
preference for unitary single-tier authorities.
