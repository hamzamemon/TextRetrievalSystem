Outgoing champions Britain lost all hope of another medal when they were
humiliated 6-0 by Australia in the men's hockey. 'We were disappointed with
the scoreline,' said British coach Norman Hughes. 'We played some bloody
good hockey.'
Britain's star striker Sean Kerly confirmed that he intends to quit
international hockey following his team's defeat.
