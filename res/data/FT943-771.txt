Hungary intends to fine Colgate-Palmolive, the US consumer and products
group, Ft30m (Pounds 176,300) for what it considers 'misleading advertising'
in a toothpaste TV commercial. The decision follows a complaint by Procter &amp;
Gamble of the US, one of the company's main rivals, to the economic
competition office in Budapest. The office said a commercial by
Colgate-Palmolive which claims calcium helps prevent tooth decay had not
been scientifically proved.
