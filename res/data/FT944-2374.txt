Some good news at last from BTR, the giant conglomerate which has lost its
premium rating after underperforming the stock market by around a quarter
over the past six months. It has just won a ProShare award for its success
in attracting private shareholders. ProShare singled out BTR for attracting
over 500 new shareholders a week despite its falling share price. Were the
company to expend as much effort explaining itself to the City, its shares
might be trading at rather less humble levels.
