Sir, Michael Dixon's relaying of advice from a marketing consultant working
from New York (Recruitment, June 3) that the way round the secretary barrier
is to misplace the word 'not' can only result in increasing isolation for
top UK managers now that their secretaries will rigorously filter out all
calls from 'we've met before' claimants.
Perhaps the marketing consultant, who advises on the packaging of ideas and
products, should champion a telephonic lie-detector, the US market for
which, on this evidence, should be quite large.
