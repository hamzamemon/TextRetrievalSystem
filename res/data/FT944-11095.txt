British sufferers from 'Desert Storm Syndrome' have been allowed to join the
class action brought by US service personnel against 30 manufact-
urers of chemical or biological weapons materials supplied to Iraq before
the Gulf War.
A court in Houston, Texas, last week gave UK victims until November 22 to
join the action which involves more than 1,000 US servicemen and women. Donn
&amp; Co, the UK solicitors co-ordinating the British claims, have written to
more than 400 people advising them of their rights. The action alleges
negligence and a breach of US product liability rules.
