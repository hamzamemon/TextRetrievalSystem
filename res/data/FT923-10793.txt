Many leading German businessmen, politicians and civil servants think
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right government is too weak, according to
an opinion poll published by the business monthly Capital yesterday, Reuter
reports from Bonn.
The respondents felt Mr Kohl had fallen short on pledges to cut government
subsidies, fight crime and develop a new energy policy. About one-third felt
Mr Wolfgang Schauble, leader of Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats in parliament,
would make a better chancellor.
