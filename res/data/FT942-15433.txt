The UK is to launch a drive to attract investment from the world's
pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies to take advantage of the siting
in the country of the European Medicines Evaluation agency.
The campaign will be run by the departments of trade and industry and of
health and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.
