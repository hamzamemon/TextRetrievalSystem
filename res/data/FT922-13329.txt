At least four men were injured in a gas explosion yesterday on board the
Claymore oil production platform 80 miles north-east of Aberdeen.
An official of Elf Enterprise, which owns the platform, said none of the
injuries was serious.
The company said 'a minor emergency' was declared after a small explosion
damaged the exhaust system on one of the platform's compressors.
