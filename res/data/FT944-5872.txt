Losses at Lister &amp; Co increased sharply in the half-year to October 1,
because of depressed demand in the textile sector and losses in the
engineering businesses.
On static sales of Pounds 17.7m the pre-tax deficit jumped from Pounds
268,000 to Pounds 700,000. On a per share basis the loss worked through at
4.32p (1.85p).
Lister said its engineering business had been reviewed and a new managing
director had been appointed.
