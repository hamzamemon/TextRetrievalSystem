TAX WORKERS have voted by a narrow majority to end industrial action after
concessions from the Inland Revenue on a performance-pay system.
They voted by 22,865 to 21,283 to accept the interim package, which includes
the winding-up of the staff appraisal system. Their union, the Inland
Revenue Staff Federation, recommended acceptance of the interim deal.
