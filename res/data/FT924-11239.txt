Small and medium-sized companies in the UK are far more dependent on
short-term finance than their continental European counterparts, according
to a survey* by 3i, the venture capital company, and Cranfield School of
Management.
Overdraft and short-term finance accounted for 76 per cent of the total
finance of British companies. Only 25 per cent of British companies had ever
used long-term loans compared with 64 per cent of German companies and
between 45 and 53 per cent of companies in France, Italy and Spain.
This dependence on short-term finance meant UK companies are badly placed to
weather the recession and explained cutbacks in investment said Paul Burns,
director of the 3i/Cranfield Enterprise Centre.
A total of 739 companies responded to the survey.
