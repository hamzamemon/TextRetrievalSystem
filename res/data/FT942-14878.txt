West Indian batsman Brian Lara scored the highest single-innings total in
Test cricket, beating countryman Sir Garfield Sobers' 365 not out, on the
third day of the fifth Test against England at St John's, Antigua. Sobers
was on hand to congratulate the 24-year-old left-hander, who was dismissed
before lunch for 375. The West Indies immediately declared at 593-5. At the
close England were 185-2.
