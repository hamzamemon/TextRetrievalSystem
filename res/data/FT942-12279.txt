Substantial numbers of Inland Revenue staff plan to switch their votes from
the Conservatives to Labour, a survey by MORI, the research organisation,
for the Inland Revenue Staff Federation has found.
The poll of 1,000 federation members found a 14.5 per cent swing from the
Tories to Labour since the 1992 general election, with 62 per cent
supporting Labour, 12 per cent the Conservatives and 24 per cent the Liberal
Democrats.
