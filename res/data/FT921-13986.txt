South Korean demonstrators write protests in blood during an anti-Japan
rally in Seoul yesterday as Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa met
President Roh Tae-woo. The two countries agreed to hold talks on trade
co-operation but refused to cut tariffs on South Korean exports, government
officials said.
South Korea had called for tariff cuts on 16 items which are exported to
Japan, removal of non-tariff barriers on leather and fishing industry
products and a pledge on technology transfers.
