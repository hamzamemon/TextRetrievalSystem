Alvis, the engineering group, has sold its 34 per cent stake in Sopelem, the
french electro-optics company to Societe de Fabrication d'Instruments de
Mesure, which holds the other 66 per cent, for Pounds 4.1m.
The proceeds will be used in expanding Alvis's specialist engineering
interests both organically and by acquisition.
