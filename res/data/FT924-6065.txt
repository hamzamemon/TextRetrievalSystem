Most political parties backed Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao yesterday in
his efforts to avert a confrontation with Hindu hardliners over the building
of a temple on a disputed site where a mosque already stands, Reuter reports
form New Delhi. Political leaders attending an all-party meeting - boycotted
by Hindu militants - assured the government of their support to any action
to prevent resumption of temple construction in the northern town of
Ayodhya.
