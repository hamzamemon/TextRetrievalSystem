CADBURY, THE chocolate maker, has asked Birmingham City Council for planning
permission to build a Pounds 17m temperature-controlled warehouse at
Minworth, on the eastern side of the city, in a business park owned by a
subsidiary of Severn Trent Water.
Seventy jobs will be created at the warehouse. The first phase of its
development is expected to be completed in July next year.
