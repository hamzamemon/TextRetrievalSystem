China swore in its first set of Hong Kong advisers yesterday amid growing
fears of Chinese interference in the affairs of the British colony before it
returns to Chinese rule in 1997.
The 43 advisers, largely pro-China political and business leaders, were
sworn in at a Beijing ceremony attended by China's Premier Li Peng and
President Yang Shangkun.
Chinese officials have assured Britain that the advisers will not become a
second power centre but have made no secret of their importance.
