The New Straits Times Press, Malaysia's largest newspaper and publishing
group, announced pre-tax profits for the year ended August 31 1993 of
MDollars 92.2m (Dollars 35.5m), a marginal increase on the previous year's
MDollars 92m, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
Group turnover improved 11 per cent to MDollars 422.6m.
The company said higher taxation costs and depreciation on capital
expenditure from new printing facilities kept the increase small.
