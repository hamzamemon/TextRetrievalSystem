Losses at Beauford, the engineering and ceramics group which completed a
refinancing package earlier this year, were cut from Pounds 26.4m to Pounds
7.43m pre-tax for 1993.
Turnover of continuing operations slipped from Pounds 28.6m to Pounds 27.5m
and losses per share worked through at 9p (32p).
The 1992 deficit included a Pounds 19.5m provision for goodwill in
continuing operations.
Sir Trevor Holdsworth, chairman, said trading conditions remained difficult
in the second half, but added that there was evidence of a recovery in the
last two months which led to a 'significant' increase in order intake.
Although that was too late to affect the 1993 results, the trading
improvement had spilled over into the current year. Most parts of the group
were now operating profitably and further improvement was looked for during
the year.
Refinancing included a restructuring of bank debt and the raising of new
money via a placing and rights issue. The directors believed the group would
have ceased trading without the package.
