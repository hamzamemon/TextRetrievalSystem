Shares in Colorvision, the Liverpool-based television and video retailer,
fell 15p to 48p yesterday, as directors forecast a drop in year-end pre-tax
profits from Pounds 1.78m to about Pounds 200,000.
An improving sales trend, which had been noted during the third quarter of
the year to March 31, did not continue beyond January, they explained. Sales
in the last two months of the period 'fell below expectations'.
The directors added that 'it would not be appropriate to pay a final
dividend'.
