Pen-based computers have proven their worth in gathering information outside
the office - in particular for filling in forms. But back at the office the
data has to be downloaded into the office computer system.
To make life easier, pen computer specialist Grid, part of the Tandy group,
has developed a computer which combines the best of both worlds. The screen
can be written on with the attached stylus. It then swivels back to reveal a
keyboard which can be used to incorporate the data into, for instance, a
report.
The Grid Convertible costs Pounds 2,700 and comes with MS-Dos and
Microsoft's Windows software designed for pen computing. Tandy Grid: US, 817
