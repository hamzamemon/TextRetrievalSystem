SCOTTISH nationalists promised a programme of action during next month's EC
summit in Edinburgh including a demonstration in the city to stress their
case for home rule.
Meanwhile Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, announced plans to give Scotland
a greater say within the European Community. But he said the prospect of an
independent Scotland within Europe was a 'fantasy'.
Asserting that Scots often got on better with continental Europeans than the
English, he offered the prospect of Scotland having more influence in the
EC, while staying within the UK.
