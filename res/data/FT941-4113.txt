Footsie futures fell sharply and dragged the cash market down on the last
day of the equity trading account, writes Clare Gascoigne.
A sustained fall in UK government bonds saw the FT-SE 100 contract for March
expiry hit a low of 3,165 in the afternoon. Technical factors were blamed
for much of the weakness and a late rally saw the contract hit 3,171 by the
official close. Turnover was heavier than usual with just under 20,000
contracts dealt.
In traded options, volume rose to 56,834 contracts. Barclays was the most
active stock option, trading 4,257.
