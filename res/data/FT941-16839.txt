Starmin, the quarry products company chaired by Lord Parkinson, has sold
Brand &amp; Rae, the Fife-based manufacturer of dense and lightweight building
blocks and concrete roofing tiles, for Pounds 413,000 cash.
Starmin is responsible for collection of debts and payment of creditors
prior to the sale. The deal forms part of the company's strategy of reducing
borrowings by disposing of non-core assets.
In the 11 months to November 1993 Brand &amp; Rae incurred an operating loss of
Pounds 26,000. Unaudited net assets at the sale date of December 23 were
Pounds 428,000.
Starmin said the loss on disposal would be increased by the write-off of
goodwill amounting to Pounds 830,000.
