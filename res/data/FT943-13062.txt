Renewable energy forms 'offer a very long-term promise for a permanent
solution' to energy problems, the World Energy Council says today.
Renewables, which include solar, wind and wave power, must take account of
all environmental impacts, and avoid unsound technology and economics, the
group says.
It estimates that renewables will account for about 4 per cent of world
energy by 2020 if present policies are pursued. But if more ecological
policies were adopted, renewables could contribute 12 per cent by the same
date.
