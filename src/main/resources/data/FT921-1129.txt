THE AMERICAN investor Warren Buffett confirms in his eagerly awaited annual
report to shareholders that his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
has purchased a stake of more than 31.2m shares in Guinness for Dollars
264.8m (Pounds 153m).
The purchase represents the first time that the investment conglomerate has
made a significant investment in a company domiciled outside the US. In the
report, Buffett writes: 'Guinness  .. earns its money in much the same
fashion as Coca-Cola and Gillette, US-based companies that garner most of
their profits from international operations.'
Berkshire owns about 7 per cent of the capital stock of Coca-Cola Co. and
about 11 per cent of Gillette. Chief financial officer J. Verne McKenzie
said the company would not elaborate on the Guinness purchase beyond Mr
Buffett's remarks.
