NOTHING SENDS a seminar audience to sleep faster than another dull overhead
slide presentation. But integrating computer graphics, video and sound has
been costly and complicated.
However, General Parametrics, the US group which made its name in the
business presentations market, has introduced the VideoShow HQ, a
fully-integrated, portable multimedia presentation system which is compact,
simple to operate and relatively cheap.
The system is built around a 3.6kg box of electronic tricks costing Dollars
6,765 (Pounds 3,850) in its basic configuration. It offers the impact of
multimedia with full-motion video, live video, stereo sound, photographic
images, animation and high-quality computer graphics. Its designers claim it
is simple enough for anyone to use.
General Parametrics: US, 510 524 3950.
