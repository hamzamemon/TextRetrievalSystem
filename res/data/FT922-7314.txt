A REDUCTION in the number of house repossessions would give a strong
stimulus to house prices, according to an article in the latest Bank of
England quarterly bulletin.
According to the Bank's economics division, a reduction in the number of
house repossessions by 20,000 for one year (there were about 75,000 last
year) would increase house prices by about 5 per cent above rises that would
otherwise have occurred.
