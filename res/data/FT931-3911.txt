French fishermen yesterday renewed up their protests against rising fish
imports by ransacking two refrigerated depots in the port of Saint-Brieuc.
The fishermen emptied crates of South African and Australian shellfish on
the the floor leaving the contents to rot, Alice Rawsthorn writes from
Paris.
Meanwhile a number of French fishing vessels from Bayonne were damaged when
they blockaded a Spanish patrol boat in French waters. The French
authorities agreed to pay compensation to the owners of the damaged boats.
