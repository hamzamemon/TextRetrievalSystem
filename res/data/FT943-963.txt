Woolwich Building Society, the UK's third-largest, yesterday became the last
of the big societies to announce a mortgage rate rise in response to the 0.5
percentage point base rate increase earlier this month. From September 28
its standard variable mortgage rate is rising from 7.75 per cent to 8.1 per
cent.
