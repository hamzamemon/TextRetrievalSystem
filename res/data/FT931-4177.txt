CAMBODIAN gunmen killed at least 34 Vietnamese settlers in an attack on a
fishing village on Wednesday, the worst massacre since the main Cambodian
factions signed a peace accord in 1991, the United Nations announced
yesterday, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok
The extremist Khmer Rouge guerrilla group, which has campaigned vociferously
against the presence of the Vietnamese in Cambodia, was immediately
suspected of the killings at a lakeside village of houseboats, near Siem
Reap, in Cambodia's north west.
The massacre is another setback for the United Nations Transitional
Authority in Cambodia's attempts to hold a general election in May. Even
before the latest atrocity, its head, Mr Yasushi Akashi, had said conditions
were not yet suitable for an election.
