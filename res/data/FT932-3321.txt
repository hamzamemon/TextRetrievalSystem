SYSTEMS for checking the quality of drinking water in England and Wales were
given a clean bill of health yesterday.
Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, announced that Professor Peter Stott had
found that the methods used by the Drinking Water Inspectorate were
'appropriate and sufficient'.
The review was announced last October to see if the methods were appropriate
for checking that water companies were complying with their statutory
duties.
