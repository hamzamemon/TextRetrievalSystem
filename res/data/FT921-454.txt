Norma Major, the prime minister's wife, must have wondered whether she had
caught the wrong bus yesterday. On her husband's visit to a General Electric
plant outside Cardiff, the local host welcomed everyone on the platform
party except her. A few minutes later Lord King, chairman of British
Airways, who accompanied the party, similarly ignored her presence.
While the prime minister spent half an hour touring the US company's engine
works, she was left behind among the throng in the reception centre. At one
point she looked quite forlorn, leaning against the wall on her own.
