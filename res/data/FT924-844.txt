A HIGH Court judge yesterday rejected a lawsuit against the administrators
of Canary Wharf by Bear Stearns, a US investment bank that occupies 20,000
sq ft of the London Docklands development, Vanessa Houlder writes.
Bear Stearns claimed that it was entitled to rescind its Canary Wharf lease
because Olympia &amp; York, the developer, had breached its agreement to pay the
rent on Bear Stearns' former premises at Devonshire Square.
Mr Justice Morritt concluded in the High Court that there had been no
breach. O&amp;Y commonly offered to take responsibility for a tenant's old
premises as an incentive to move to Canary Wharf.
