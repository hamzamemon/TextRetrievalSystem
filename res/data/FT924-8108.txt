MEASURES to alleviate the economic consequences of pit closures on the coal
communities will take longer than two years to implement, Lord Walker of
Worcester told the employment committee yesterday, Cathy Milton writes
Lord Walker, who is co-ordinating the programme of assistance measures, said
that while his appointment was for two years, measures would have to be
implemented on a 'continuing rolling programme'.
'I will be involved as long as it is necessary,' he told the committee.
Lord Walker indicated he would favour a more gradual programme of closures
than the government originally announced.
