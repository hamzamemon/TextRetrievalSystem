IMPERIAL Chemical Industries' Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) of long-term debt
has been placed under review for possible downgrade by Standard &amp; Poor's,
the US rating agency, following Thursday's announcement that the group may
be divided into two separate public companies.
Moody's, the other leading US rating agency, said it is expanding its review
of the company's debt to include the rating implications of the split.
Moody's placed ICI's debt under review for possible downgrade on July 15,
prompted by increasing evidence of a slower pace of recovery in
profitability.
ICI's debt is currently rated AA- by S&amp;P and AA3 by Moody's.
Although the future capital structures of the two companies has not been
determined, S&amp;P expected 'a large portion of existing debt' to remain at
ICI, which would then consist of the less profitable and more cyclical
industrial chemical operations.
