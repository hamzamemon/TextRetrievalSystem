The Czech government yesterday retaliated against Slovakia's imposition of a
10 per cent import tax by unilaterally devaluing the special currency used
for Czech-Slovak trade, Reuter reports. The Czech government devalued the
Czech crown used within the special clearing currency by 3 per cent.
Slovakia yesterday introduced a 10 per cent tax on imports of many consumer
goods to curb its mounting trade deficit, which totalled 26.7bn crowns in
1993. Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister (left), said the Slovak tax
was a 'semi-devaluation' of the Slovak crown.
