An extraordinary general meeting of Telfos, the troubled railway engineering
company, has approved the subscription for 12.3m shares by Jenbacher Werke.
The purchase takes the stake held by the Austrian maker of rolling stock to
29.99 per cent.
Dr Norbert Froemmer and Dr Bernhard Ebner are to join the Telfos board as
Jenbacher's representatives.
As planned, following the completion of the capital injection, Mr Stephen
Cockburn is stepping down as chairman and a director and Mr Douglas Morton
has been invited to act as chairman.
