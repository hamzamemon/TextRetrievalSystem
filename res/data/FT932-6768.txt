THE TREASURY yesterday announced two measures to make it easier to attract
private investment for public infrastructure and services.
It has published guidance notes making it easier for public-sector bodies to
lease goods and services from the private sector other than for property and
roads. Leases covered by the guidance will be subject to a value-for-money
test.
There will also be proposals to help offset the cost to private investors of
developing schemes which then go to open competition.
