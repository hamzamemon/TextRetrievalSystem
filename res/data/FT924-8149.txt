SIR PATRICK Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday that the UK
government would continue to look to dialogue - not an imposed solution - to
end the province's political problems.
In spite of the failure of the latest set of 'round-table' talks, which
collapsed on Tuesday, Sir Patrick said the government would 'steadily
persevere'. He said the participants had shown a 'marked increase in the
understanding of the position taken by others and respect for them'.
