HEAVY demand for YPF, Argentina's recently-privatised oil company, pushed
its shares to a USDollars 6 premium in frantic grey market trading in Buenos
Aires, writes John Barham.
Against an offer price of Dollars 19, YPF stock closed at Dollars 21.65, 14
per cent up. At lunchtime it reached Dollars 25 due to heavy demand from
institutional investors. But YPF depressed other stocks.
