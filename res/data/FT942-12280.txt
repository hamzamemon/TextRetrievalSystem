Reliance Mutual Insurance Society yesterday agreed in the High Court to pay
Pounds 150,000 in compensation and costs to two video companies after more
than 125 illegally copied training films were found at the society's head
office in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, and a branch office in Cambridge.
The action was brought by Video Arts, founded by comedian John Cleese, and
Melrose Film Productions.
