Sudan yesterday announced the introduction of a new currency which it said
would help fight inflation and reduce the cost of printing banknotes, Reuter
reports from Khartoum. The Bank of Sudan said the currency, the dinar, would
be worth 10 Sudanese pounds. Accordingly, a dollar would fetch about 10
dinars at today's rate of exchange. The Sudanese pound would continue to
circulate alongside the dinar for some time.
