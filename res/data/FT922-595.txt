THE PACKAGING industry yesterday moved to counter criticisms that it is
unresponsive to consumer and environmental pressures by launching the
Packaging Council as a forum for debate.
The 16-member council, to be chaired by Lord Clinton Davis, the former EC
environment commissioner, will include representatives from municipal
authorities, consumer goods manufacturers, retailers, packaging companies
and environmental consultancies.
