European Community foreign ministers meet their counterparts from the
Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) in Manila on Friday, Reuter
reports from Manila. Human rights concerns, which have blocked a new
economic co-operation agreement between the EC and Asean, will be high on
the agenda.
