Due to an error a table which appeared in the Financial Times of October
24/25 under the headline 'Flying into a storm of competitor protest' was
entitled: Gatwick Market Shares in 1991. This should have read: UK Airlines
Overall Market Shares in 1991.
We apologise for the error. The correct table is reprinted below.
