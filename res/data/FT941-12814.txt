The first flight of the prototype of the Eurofighter 2000 may take place at
the Farnborough air show in September, Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister for
defence procurement, told the Commons last night.
He said the flight-control system was undergoing final testing prior to
clearance for the aircraft's first flight.
