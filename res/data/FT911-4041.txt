Pounds 9.5m to buy DacEasy, a US-based accounting software company through a
combination of Pounds 3.5m cash and a 1-for-5 rights issue at 200p a share,
said that some 98.8 per cent of the shares had been taken up by existing

protection under the provisions of the US bankruptcy code, but contrary to
