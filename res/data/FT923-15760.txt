UKRAINE is seeking a Dollars 1.52bn (Pounds 820m) stabilisation fund from
the west to support its currency, the hryvnia, after it has quit the Russian
rouble zone, Mr Vadim Hetman, chairman of the Ukraine National Bank, said in
London yesterday.
Mr Hetman said Ukraine plans to leave the rouble zone, which maintains
parity between Russian and Ukrainian currencies, by October 1. It will then
allow its interim 'coupon' currency, at present used domestically, to float
in value. Technical preparations for introducing the hryvnia should be
completed by next January. But it is unclear whether Ukraine will introduce
the hryvnia and new hryvnia bank notes then.
Mr Hetman said Ukraine had not yet decided whether to peg the hryvnia to a
specific currency, though the Ecu and a basket of western currencies were
being considered.
