AMERICA West Airlines, which is operating in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, has
reached agreements in principle to expand its debtor-in-possession financing
by at least Dollars 45m and up to Dollars 60m, Reuter reports from Phoenix.
In addition, America West said that it expected to obtain 'additional
financial benefits' of more than Dollars 137m from aircraft providers and
other sources, including aircraft lessor GPA Group of Ireland.
America West, which operated chiefly in the south-west and west of the US,
said that the new financing would 'significantly enhance' its ability to
file a plan of reorganisation in the near term. It would also support the
airline's recently announced strategic cuts and related route realignments.
America West said the agreement in principle on the expanded
debtor-in-possession financing was subject to conditions, including the
receipt of commitments on terms acceptable to both America West and its
lenders for Dollars 10m of the minimum Dollars 45m. It said talks for the
commitments were in final stages.
