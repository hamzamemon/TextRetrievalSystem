Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi won a confidence vote in the Italian
parliament yesterday but politicians said he would probably have to face
several more to win approval for his crucial 1994 budget, Reuter reports
from Rome. Opposition parties object to its cost-cutting measures and Mr
Ciampi's supporters now seem set to use the budget to help delay a general
election, which would almost certainly cripple them.
