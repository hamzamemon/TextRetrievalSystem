GOLD continued its recovery yesterday, helped by buying from a large bank.
But SILVER managed only a marginal rise.
An early dip in the COPPER market quickly found support and prices ended
little changed. ZINC also rallied after an initial fall, against a
background of possible strike action at a Colombian mine.
