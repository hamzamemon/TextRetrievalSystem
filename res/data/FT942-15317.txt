Israel's main telecommunications company, Bezeq, posted a 22.5 per cent rise
in net profit, to Shk282.6m (Dollars 94.3m) in 1993, Reuter reports from
Jerusalem.
The company - 23 per cent has been sold on the Tel Aviv stock exchange and a
further 23 per cent is due to be floated this year - attributed the rise to
efficiency measures and increased telephone use.
