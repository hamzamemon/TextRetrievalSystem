LIBYA said yesterday it was ready to hand over two Libyan suspects in the
bombing of US and French airliners to any international commission, Reuter
reports from Ankara.
The UN Security Council this month ordered Tripoli to hand over two Libyan
agents indicted in Scotland and the US for the 1988 bombing of an airliner
over the Scottish village of Lockerbie, in which 270 people were killed.
France wants Libya to co-operate with an inquiry into the 1989 bomb
explosion on a French UTA airliner over Niger, which killed 171 people.
