Amoco, the US energy group, said it would take a post-tax charge of Dollars
256m in the second quarter of its financial year to cover a reorganisation
in which 3,800 jobs will be cut. The announcement marks the end of a process
begun in March, when it first disclosed it was preparing a full-scale
restructuring of its operations.
The company said it expected to incur further restructuring charges of
Dollars 200m by the end of 1996, and shed an additional 2,000 jobs.
The move, which echoes cost-cutting at other US oil groups in recent months,
is intended to reduce annual expenses by Dollars 600m a year by the end of
1995.
