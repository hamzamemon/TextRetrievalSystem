Sir, For all the scoffing at the idea of a tax on fossil fuels, is there not
a case for the UK to take unilateral action? Some Pounds 30bn switched from
employers' National Insurance contributions to fuel is surely in line with
the Conservatives' philosophy on indirect taxation and it might even reverse
the trend in redundancies.
