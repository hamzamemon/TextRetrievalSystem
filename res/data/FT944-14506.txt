Azlan Group, the computer networking products distributor, said operating
profits for the half year to September 30 would be in line with management
expectations at about Pounds 1.2m.
Sales were expected to be Pounds 37.7m, with a gross profit margin of about
25 per cent. Trading had been slow in the UK in the first half of the year
but overseas trading was strong and an improvement was expected in the
second half.
