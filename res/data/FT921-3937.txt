The Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) should take a unified
stand against Burma for mistreating its Moslem minority, Mr Najib Razak,

About 170,000 Burmese Moslems known as Rohingyas have fled to Bangladesh
since December, accusing Burmese troops of burning their homes, stealing
their belongings, raping women and killing those who protested.
