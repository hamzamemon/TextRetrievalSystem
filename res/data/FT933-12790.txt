A PLAN by Mr Adam Page, founder of Midsummer Leisure, to reverse some of his
businesses into Hoskins Brewery, one of Britain's smallest quoted brewers,
has formally lapsed although both parties say they remain committed to the
deal, writes Catherine Milton
Completion of the deal to inject three Fatty Arbuckle's theme bars into
Hoskins in return for 41 per cent of its equity, was subject to notice being
sent to shareholders by July 16.
This date could not be met partly because of calls for clarification from
the Stock Exchange and partly because of Hoskins' own due diligence. The
delays meant that three successive completion deadlines were missed.
Hoskins said: 'Discussions are still continuing with a view to resolving the
outstanding matters in relation to the acquisition.
