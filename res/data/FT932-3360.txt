Philippine President Fidel Ramos signed a law to create the Central Monetary
Authority to replace the heavily-indebted central bank, Reuter reports from
Manila. 'The Central Bank was in a state of decrepitude, haemorrhaging from
a huge deficit amounting to more than 300bn pesos (Pounds 7.4bn),' Mr Ramos
said.
