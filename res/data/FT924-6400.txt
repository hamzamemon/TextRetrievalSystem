MR Lorrain Osman, the banker who is Britain's longest-serving unconvicted
prisoner, failed yesterday in his ninth court move to avoid extradition to
Hong Kong for trial on fraud charges.
Two High Court judges refused to grant a writ of habeas corpus and accused
him of taking the action 'to filibuster'. Mr Osman has been fighting
extradition for five years.
