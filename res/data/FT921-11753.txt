IN LIGHT of US investors' expanding interest in mid-sized growth companies,
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the American Stock Exchange have
announced they will jointly launch derivative products based on the new
Standard &amp; Poor's MidCap 400 Index.
On February 13, the CME will offer futures and options on futures and the
American Stock Exchange will begin trading options on the S&amp;P MidCap 400.
Introduced by Standard &amp; Poor's last year, the MidCap Index is composed of
400 companies with a median capitalisation of Dollars 754m and total market
value of about Dollars 425bn. To date, investors have indexed almost Dollars
3bn in assets to the S&amp;P MidCap 400.
Both exchanges were granted exclusive licences to trade derivative
instruments on the MidCap index last September.
The Securities and Exchange Commission, the securities industry regulator,
has approved the American Stock Exchange's use of the MidCap, and approval
by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the futures industry regulator,
is expected for the CME on February 11.
The New York Commodity Exchange filed an application with the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission to list futures and options on futures based on
the Eurotop 100 index. Comex made its application after reaching an
agreement with the European Options Exchange in Amsterdam, which trades and
controls rights to the index.
