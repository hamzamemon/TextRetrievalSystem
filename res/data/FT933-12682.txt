The Netherlands plans to liberalise its telecommunications infrastructure in
1995 by allowing the country's railway company, cable television companies
and electricity utilities to lease their lines and cables to business
customers, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. The use of the lines will
be limited to data communication and to 'closed user' networks, as in the
case of internal communication between a company's offices around the
country.
