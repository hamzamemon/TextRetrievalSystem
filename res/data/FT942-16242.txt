The French centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur suffered a 10 per
cent decline in its popularity and support last month, according to a poll
by the Louis Harris market research consultancy. At the end of March the
government commanded the approval of just 41 per cent of the French public
against 51 per cent a month earlier, according to the poll commissioned by
Profession Politique magazine. The proportion of the electorate claiming to
be dissatisfied with the government rose by 10 points to 54 per cent over
the same period. The fall in support for Mr Balladur's policies follows his
abandonment of plans to cut the minimum wage for young workers after violent
protests from students and youths. It also reflects concern about the
continuing pressures on the French economy.
