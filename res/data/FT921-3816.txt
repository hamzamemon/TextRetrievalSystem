Pakistan said yesterday it would represent Iran in the US, replacing
Algeria, whose crackdown on Islamic fundamentalists has soured relations
with Tehran, Reuter reports from Islamabad.
A foreign ministry spokesman said Islamabad had agreed to a request from
Tehran to look after an Iranian interests section in Washington. He said
Pakistan was maintaining friendly relations with both countries.
The US broke off diplomatic relations with Iran in early 1980 after Iranian
militants seized the US embassy in Tehran.
