DR AVI SHLAIM, reader in international relations and fellow of St Anthony's
College, Oxford, has been awarded the David Watt memorial prize for writers
specialising in national, international and political issues.
The Pounds 5,000 prize, sponsored by RTZ Corporation, has been awarded for
Dr Shlaim's article on Israel and the Gulf published in the London Review of
Books in January last year. The annual award commemorates the life and work
of David Watt, a writer regarded as one of the outstanding political
commentators of his generation, who died in 1987.
