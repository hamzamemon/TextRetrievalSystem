The US and Britain signed a mutual legal assistance treaty yesterday to
boost co-operation in the fight against crime.
The treaty provides for mutual assistance in securing testimony or
documents, conducting searches and seizures, transferring people in custody
for testimony as witnesses and co-operation in confiscating criminals'
assets.
