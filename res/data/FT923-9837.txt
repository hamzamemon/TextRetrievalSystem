Sir, Yvonne Bennion (Letters, July 30) may well be right in stating that the
phrase 'team briefing' has become part of the workplace vocabulary. Since
other equally appealing phrases such as 'project manager' and 'early
release' have also made their way into the top ten of most used workplace
terms this hardly proves a great deal, however.
Team briefings may well be a useful way of informing staff of developments
but in my experience they are rarely as brief, or as informative, as one
would like them to be.
