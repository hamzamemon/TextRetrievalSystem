President Boris Yeltsin is understood to have ditched the official draft
Russian constitution following attempts by parliament's constitutional
committee to reduce his emergency powers, Leyla Boulton reports.
Although a new constitution has been one of Mr Yeltsin's chief political
goals, he has effectively killed the prospect of endowing Russia with a new
one to replace that inherited from the old communist empire at a sitting of
the Russian parliament on April 6.
A constitution not only determines the power structure in Moscow but the
relationship between the centre and the autonomous republics and regions
within the largest republic of the former Soviet Union.
