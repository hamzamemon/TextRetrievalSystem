GKN, the engineering and industrial services group, is today expected to
invite shareholders to take part in the second tranche of its Pounds 248m
rights issue to fund the takeover of Westland Group.
The move signals GKN's confidence that its revised 335p cash offer will be
accepted this week by M&amp;G and Schroders, which together control more than 25
per cent of the helicopter manufacturer.
Their acceptance would push the engineering group's holding beyond the 75
per cent barrier required to trigger the second half of the rights issue.
Last month GKN received acceptances for 90.9 per cent of the first part of
the issue - involving more than 52m units of non interest-bearing
convertible loan stock - payable in two equal instalments of 240p.
Sir David Lees, the GKN chairman, announced the fund-raising two months ago
when he launched the hostile bid for Westland. The Yeovil-based company
rejected the initial bid, priced at 290p per ordinary share, saying it
undervalued order prospects and potential profits.
Two weeks ago, however, it reluctantly recommended a revised offer which
valued the group at Pounds 577m.
