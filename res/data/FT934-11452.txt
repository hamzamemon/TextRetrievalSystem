Algerian security forces have secured the release of the three French
hostages kidnapped in Algiers a week ago, Reuter reports from Algiers.
The Algerian and French governments did not immediately say how or where Mr
Jean-Claude Thevenot and Mr Alain Freissier were found. As the two men
arrived back in Paris last night Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister,
said the third, Mrs Michele Thevenot, was at the French embassy in Algiers.
