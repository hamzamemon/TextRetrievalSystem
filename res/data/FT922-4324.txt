THE HONG KONG government has approved a lengthening of the settlement period
on the colony's stock market to two days after a trade from the current
one-day period to cope with huge turnover, Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
Mr Robert Nottle, the chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission,
told a news conference that the change would be announced officially this
weekend. Daily turnover has soared during recent weeks, occasionally rising
above HKDollars 6bn (Dollars 775m).
Mr Nottle noted that the number of transactions has totalled 50,000 or more
a day recently, compared with about 20,000 usually. He said the change
should not increase the risks of trading in Hong Kong.
