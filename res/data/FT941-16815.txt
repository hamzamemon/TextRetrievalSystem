Beneteau, the French pleasure boat company, fell further into the red in its
last financial year to August 31 when it made a net loss of FFr20.7m
(Dollars 3.5m), against a deficit of FFr4.6m in the previous year.
The company, controlled by the Beneteau family, has been badly affected by
the European economic recession on the pleasure boat market.
