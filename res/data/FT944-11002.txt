Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecoms group, has been selected by an alliance of
small US wireless operators to provide long-distance telecoms services to
knit together their proposed networks.
C&amp;W's US subsidiary is already an established long-distance US operator, and
the contract does not require heavy investment.
However, C&amp;W said that if the wireless operators - all small and
medium-sized concerns - succeeded in gaining licences for new 'personal
communications services' (PCS) networks, the resulting business could be
worth 'several hundred millions of dollars a year' to C&amp;W within five years.
The PCS licences are due to be auctioned next year by the Federal
Communications Commission, the US regulatory authority. The FCC has reserved
a proportion of the licences for smaller operators.
AT&amp;T, the US operator and equipment supplier, will supply network equipment
for the alliance.
C&amp;W's US subsidiary had a turnover of Dollars 560m last year.
