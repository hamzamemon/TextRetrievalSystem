British Airways said yesterday it was being sued by six Britons in Edinburgh
held hostage from a flight that landed in Kuwait hours after the Iraqi
invasion two years ago, Reuter reports.
BA is also being sued by 65 French passengers and 48 relatives of passengers
on BA's flight 149 who demanded compensation for mental anguish. The French
lawsuit demands FFr52m (Pounds 5.3m).
