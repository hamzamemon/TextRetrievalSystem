Customers will be able to see into betting shops following moves by Mr
Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday to loosen restrictions
covering their front windows.
Bookmakers, which now have to operate behind obscured frontages, will be
able to have clear windows and display information on facilities in the
shops and bets available. They will also be able to sell a wider range of
pre-packaged snacks and sandwiches and to use larger television screens.
