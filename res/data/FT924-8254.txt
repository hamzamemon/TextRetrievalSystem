CERAMCO, the New Zealand lingerie maker, is to launch its products in Europe
and Canada, after a 50 per cent sales rise in Australia in the six months to
June 30, the company said yesterday.
The boost in Australian sales followed Ceramco's purchase of Hickory
Fashions.
Ceramco doubled interim pre-tax profits after extraordinary items to
NZDollars 15.03m (USDollars 7.9m). Sales rose 26 per cent to NZDollars
78.24m.
Net profits edged ahead to NZDollars 7.5m from NZDollars 7.17m.
