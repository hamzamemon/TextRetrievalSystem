Hidden unemployment in Russia is running at 20m-30m people, according to Ms
Natasha Podshibyakina, head of the trade union department of the Russian
General Confederation of Trade Unions, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. Speaking
at a conference organised in Moscow yesterday by the International Labour
Organisation, Ms Podshibyakina, whose figures were challenged by government
officials, said that they included all those who were on short-time working,
enforced breaks or holidays.
