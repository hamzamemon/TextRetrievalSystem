Iran will supply natural gas and other fuels to the Nakhichevan region of
Azerbaijan, the Iranian news agency IRNA reported yesterday.
Nakhichevan, sandwiched between Iran, Armenia and Turkey, is facing a fuel
shortage because of a blockade by Armenia, which has been fighting an
undeclared war with Azerbaijan over the disputed enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh.
