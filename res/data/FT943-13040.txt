The government was urged to institute an inquiry into the activities of
Knight Williams, the financial advisers, by a group of MPs in the Commons
yesterday.
Sir Anthony Grant, Tory MP for Cambridgeshire South West, said 50 MPs who
had signed a parliamentary motion on the issue had received complaints from
retired people, nearly all of whom had suffered losses.
