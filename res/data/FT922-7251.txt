LAFARGE Coppee, the French building materials group, expects to continue to
rein in investments in 1992, according to Mr Bertrand Collomb, the chairman,
Reuter reports from Paris.
He said the group anticipates that its net debt will grow modestly this
year. The company can finance development without turning to the bourse for
new equity capital.
Mr Collomb said that the group had set itself a goal of 'a more modest pace
of development than in recent years ..without sacrificing expansion.'
