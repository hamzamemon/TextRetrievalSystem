SONY Corporation, the Japanese electronics giant, is to set up its first
joint venture in China to make video cameras this month, under an agreement
with the Shanghai Video &amp; Audio Electronics Co (SVA).
Sony, which has been a somewhat reluctant investor in China, will provide 70
per cent of the total Dollars 5m investment in the new Shanghai Suoguang
Electronics Company. SVA will be responsible for the rest.
Production will begin in November.
The new company plans to produce 150,000 8mm video cameras annually. It will
also turn out components for video tape recorders.
