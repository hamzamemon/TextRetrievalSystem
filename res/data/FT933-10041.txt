THE CONSERVATIVE party was last night confronted with an opinion poll
putting its popularity rating at its lowest level ever, David Owen writes.
The survey, conducted by Gallup and published by The Daily Telegraph, showed
the Tories in third place on 23 per cent, a drop of 1.5 percentage points
from July.
Labour leads with 44.5 per cent, up 1.5 points, while the Liberal Democrats
have 27 per cent, up half a point.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, saw his personal rating at below 20 per
cent for the second month running.
