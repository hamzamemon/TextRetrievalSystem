THE Venezuelan government may extend its privatisation programme to
companies in the state-owned CVG (Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana), which
controls the country's heavy industry, writes Joe Mann in Caracas.
CVG, whose activities include steel, aluminium smelting and products,
mining, and hydroelectric power, has not previously figured in the
three-year-old privatisation programme. But a projected fiscal deficit this
year has caused the government to consider privatising parts of CVG, which
includes companies fully owned by the state as well as joint ventures.
