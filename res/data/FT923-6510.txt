Sir, Jurek Martin and Matthew Kaminsky suggest in their report on the
Republican convention ('Houston in a whirl as the party hurricane hits',
August 18) that 'it is the constitutional right of every Texan, and most of
the south, to drink and drive'.
Now Texans are good-natured people who enjoy poking fun at their own often
colourful attitudes. But this characterisation, though undoubtedly intended
in jest, is in bad taste. It also misrepresents the views held by most
Americans.
