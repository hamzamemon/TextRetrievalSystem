AN ARMED member of the outlawed loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force died
yesterday following the explosion at the weekend of a grenade he was
carrying.
Nearly 30 people were injured in the explosion during an Orange parade in
west Belfast.
Police said they were satisfied the grenade had been intended to be used by
loyalists if attacked and had gone off prematurely.
