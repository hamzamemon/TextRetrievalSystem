The European Commission has agreed a shipbuilding accord drafted by the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and expressed
hope that European Union member states would approve it on December 20. The
plan, designed to remove state aid from the shipbuilding sector to make it
more competitive, allows for some government support in France, which is
concerned about the effect of the pact on its shipbuilding industry.
