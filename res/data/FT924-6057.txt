LABOUR staged its own version of a special standing committee yesterday to
demonstrate the range of opposition to the government's controversial Asylum
Bill.
Angered by the government's refusal to agree to this optional parliamentary
procedure for the measure, Labour hired a committee room at Westminster and
called lawyers including Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, former chairman of the Bar
Council, and those with experience of asylum seekers to say why they had
reservations on the bill.
Mr Graham Allen, an opposition home affairs spokesman, said the government
should have set up a special committee to consider the bill instead of
rushing into the main standing committee stage.
The special committee allows MPs to call witnesses and consider a bill's
implications. It is rarely used, and only on legislation where there is some
cross-party consensus.
