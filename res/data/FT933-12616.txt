DOOMSDAY 2000, a computerised databank which its creators hope will list the
ownership, use, tenure and price of all land and property in Britain, was
unveiled yesterday by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The databank, funded by property company Capital &amp; Counties, is likely to be
of use to developers, land agents, builders and retailers.
