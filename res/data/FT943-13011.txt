T&amp;N, the motor components and materials group, yesterday announced the
appointment of Amar Sabberwal, chief executive of the company's friction
products division, to the board of Japan Brake International, the Japanese
vehicle parts business.
Sabberwal, 60, is expected to strengthen the existing links between T&amp;N and
JBI, which in 1990 formed a joint venture company, Ferodo Automotive
Products, in Nashville, Tennessee, to supply brake pads and linings to
Japanese car plants in North America and indigenous US manufacturers.
Although Sabberwal will remain in charge of the frictions business, Colin
Hope, T&amp;N chairman and chief executive, says his position with JBI would
enhance an association which has 'helped T&amp;N to meet its Japanese customers'
needs and led to T&amp;N being the first choice supplier to Japanese plants in
Europe and the US'.
The move marks the latest in a series of promotions for Sabberwal, who was
named an executive director in 1989 after serving on the board of TN
Technology, T&amp;N's central research and development facility.
Before that he was managing director of BIP Chemicals and managing director
of T&amp;N Materials Research. He is also a non-executive director of University
of Salford Holdings.
