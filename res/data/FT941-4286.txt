Spectrum Information Technologies and Mr John Sculley, the US company's
former chairman and chief executive, have agreed to withdraw the lawsuits
filed against each other last month, after of Mr Sculley's abrupt
resignation.
No details were announced. In a joint statement, the mobile data
communications company and Mr Sculley, the former chairman and chief
executive of Apple Computer, said: 'Speculation created by the repetition of
charges and counter charges is not serving any useful purpose.'
Mr Sculley resigned after less than four months with the company. He sued
Spectrum's president, Mr Peter Caserta, charging that he had hidden the
company's financial and regulatory problems. Spectrum, currently under
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, countered by suing
Sculley for breach of contract.
