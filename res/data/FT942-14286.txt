Savings of 35 per cent have been made by the Lord Chancellor's Department on
court reporting services since last year's introduction of market testing.
A National Audit Office report on the tendering and contract procedures,
published today, says the contracts were awarded on a reasonable basis
although some aspects could have been handled better. It praised the
'significant achievement' in saving money.
