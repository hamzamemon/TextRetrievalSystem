Electricity workers at National Grid, the company which oversees the
electricity transmission lines, have voted by a majority of 14 to one to
reject the company's 2.6 per cent pay offer.
The ballot of the unions that represent 4,500 electricity workers asked
members whether or not they accepted the unions' recommendation to reject
the offer.
