On the second day of his two-week US tour, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams
delivered his message of Irish reunification to the Hartford area's
Irish-American Home Society. 'If you ask me why the British don't want Sinn
Fein people to come and speak, it's because they fear your power,' Adams
said. Meanwhile, prime minister John Major has sent former Northern Ireland
minister Michael Mates to the US to counter the Adams publicity.
