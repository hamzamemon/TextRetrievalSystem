Sir, With reference to Norma Cohen's article 'Reforms that err on the safe
side' (May 9) on the recent National Association of Pension Funds
conference, I believe that much stronger safeguards should be placed on
pension funds, about whose performance it is very difficult, if not
impossible, to obtain information.
There should be a further safeguard which parliament should consider -
disclosure. The best way to see what is going on in a fund is to require
public annual reports of performance which break down investments by sector
 -gilts, equities, property etc. Then we can all see what is being done with
our money, and pick the fund of our choice.
