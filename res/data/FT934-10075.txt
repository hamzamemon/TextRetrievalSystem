THREE Swedish UN soldiers were released yesterday after being taken hostage
by Serb forces at a village in central Bosnia, writes Laura Silber in
Belgrade.
The entire group of some 30 UN soldiers was said to have had difficulty
extricating itself from the village after setting out to help about 500
Croats hiding from surrounding Moslem soldiers.
