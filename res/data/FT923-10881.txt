MR Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, assured parliament yesterday
that the 16th century Babri mosque in the northern city of Ayodhya would not
be demolished to make way for a Hindu temple, writes Shiraz Sidhvar in New
Delhi.
The dispute over the future of the mosque has caused communal tension
between Hindus and Moslems, including rioting in two states last week.
