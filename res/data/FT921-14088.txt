The tobacco lobby last night won a temporary reprieve when the European
Parliament threw back into committee a Commission plan to ban all tobacco
advertising except at the point of sale.
The controversial proposal, which follows a 1989 EC ban on TV advertising of
tobacco, hit a procedural hurdle when some heavily-lobbied MEPs successfully
demanded an opinion from the legal affairs committee on whether the
Commission was right to propose the measure for adoption by majority.
If this measure ends up requiring unanimity among EC governments, its
chances of being agreed will be much reduced.
