As a result of the rise in crimes related to credit card fraud and false
money transactions, banks and other financial institutions are looking at
improved means of recognising card holders - such as fingerprint
recognition.
Japanese electronics manufacturer NEC is launching a fingerprint recognition
system in Europe and the US that could help in the fight against crime.
The Unix-based automated fingerprint recognition system matches the
fingerprints to those held on file. Prices start from Pounds 133,000 for a
system which stores fingerprints from 50,000 people. NEC: Japan, 03 3454
