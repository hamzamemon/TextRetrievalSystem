The Go-Ahead Group, the Gateshead-based bus service operator, is to place
17.5m shares at 120p each in a flotation which will give it a market value
of Pounds 40.1m.
The proceeds of Pounds 12m will be used to pay back all of the debt assumed
to finance its recent purchase of the Brighton and Hove Bus Company and the
Oxford Bus Company.
About 16.96m shares are being placed firm with institutions, with the
balance being offered to the group's 3,500 employees. After the flotation,
the directors will control 34 per cent of the equity.
The placing has been fully underwritten by Hill Samuel, with Panmure Gordon
acting as broker. Dealings are expected to start on May 9.
