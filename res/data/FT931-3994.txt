INDIA, THE world's largest producer of sugar, has launched an effort to
increase its exportable surplus by offering a package of incentives to sugar
factories and cane growers.
Starting next month the federal government will create a sugar buffer stock
of 500,000 tonnes, the maintenance cost of which will be met from a sugar
development fund built from a levy of Rs14 (30p) a quintal (100 lb) on the
country's production.
The industry is calling, however, for a buffer stock of 1m tonnes.
The new policy confirms that India intends to be a regular exporter of sugar
and that exports will be handled by the Indian Sugar &amp; General Industry Exim
Corporation, an organisation jointly funded by the private and co-operative
sugar mills. The old policy of exporting sugar only in years of local
abundance is being given up.
In the ten months to January India exported 321,000 tonnes of sugar.
