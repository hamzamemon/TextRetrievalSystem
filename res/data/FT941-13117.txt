West End theatre attendances remained constant at about 11m in 1992 in spite
of the recession.
Attendances at the Grand National, the Derby and the Royal Tournament have
all shown recent falls. Attendances at cinemas have revived, but the number
of visits represents only 8 per cent of the 1956 level.
