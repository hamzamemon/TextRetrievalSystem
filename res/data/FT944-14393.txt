Competition between British Telecommunications and Mercury, its main rival,
is set to intensify after a report by BT claiming its service is cheaper not
only for typical home users but also for many high-volume users.
Mercury disputed some of the figures and pointed to its own discount
packages. But analysts saw the BT move as increasing pressure on Mercury to
cut its prices further to keep a competitive edge.
The BT report, verified by consultants Coopers and Lybrand, claimed that
even residential customers with phone bills well above Pounds 75 a quarter -
Mercury's target - are typically better off sticking with BT than switching
to its rival for long-distance and international calls.
