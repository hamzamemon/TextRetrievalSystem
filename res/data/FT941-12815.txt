The monthly monetary meetings of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr
Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, will be held earlier than
planned, reflecting the more prompt availability of economic and monetary
statistics.
In future the meetings and publication of the Treasury's monetary report,
prepared for the meetings, will normally take place on the first Wednesday
of each month.
