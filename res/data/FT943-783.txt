Jockey Keiran Fallon was banned from racing for six months by a Jockey Club
disciplinary inquiry which convicted him of violent and improper conduct on
a racecourse. The decision followed an incident at Beverley involving fellow
jockey Stuart Webster. Both men were cleared of a separate charge of
improper conduct.
