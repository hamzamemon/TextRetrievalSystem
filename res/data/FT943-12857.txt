Was there a subliminal message in the necktie worn by John Prescott's aide,
Ian McCartney, at yesterday's big bash in London to anoint Tony Blair as new
leader of the Labour party?
The MP for Makerfield's tie incorporated the cartoon character Bugs Bunny,
in deference to the new deputy Labour leader's nickname, Thumper.
And its label? 'Loony Toons'.
