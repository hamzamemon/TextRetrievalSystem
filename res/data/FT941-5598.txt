Shares of Goldsborough Healthcare, the nursing homes, hospitals and homecare
group, ended their first day of dealings at 170p, equal to the issue price.
Although opening below the issue price, and touching a low point of 158p,
the shares recovered during the afternoon.
The public offer part of the flotation had been marginally undersubscribed
and the pricing had been criticised for being a few pence too greedy.
