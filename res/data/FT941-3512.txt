MPs of all parties demanding tight controls to preserve the independence of
The Independent newspaper were joined yesterday by Mr Neil Kinnock, former
Labour leader, and Mr John Watts, Tory chairman of the Commons Treasury
committee.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is expected to announce
today whether he is prepared to give the go-ahead to the consortium bidding
for Newspaper Publishing, owner of The Independent and its Sunday newspaper.
The consortium, which includes Mirror Group Newspapers, owner of the Daily
Mirror, yesterday received approval from the European Commission to press
ahead with its planned takeover.
