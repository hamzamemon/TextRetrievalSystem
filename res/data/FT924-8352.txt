HYSLA, the steel subsidiary of the Mexican conglomerate Grup Alfa, is to
build a new steel plant with a capacity of 730,000 tonnes per year at an
estimated cost of Dollars 400m. The plant will increase Hysla's steel
production by 73 per cent.
The mill should be ready by early 1995, and will be the first thin-slab
casting plant, or mini-mill, in Latin America. It will be financed by a
mixture of Eximbank loans, foreign debt and by Alfa's own resources.
The company said the new plant will enable it to improve the quality and
range of its steel products and achieve one of the lower costs in the
industry, thus allowing it to compete against imports.
