SEAGRAM, the Canadian drinks group, has acquired 5.7 per cent of Time
Warner, the US media group, but said yesterday the holding was 'solely for
purposes of investment'.
The disclosure came in filings with US regulators which sought approval for
Seagram to buy up to 15 per cent of Time Warner's shares outstanding.
The 21.12m shares acquired so far were bought in a series of open-market
purchases from February 2. Time Warner closed at Dollars 38, up Dollars 1
3/8 .
Mr Edgar Bronfman, Seagram chairman, said the company believed the media and
entertainment business was one of the great growth sectors for the 1990s and
beyond.
Last week, US West, the 'Baby Bell' telephone company based in Denver,
agreed to invest Dollars 2.5bn in Time Warner's entertainment business and
jointly manage the innovative multi-media home entertainment service Time
Warner is planning.
Seagram also has a 24 per cent stake in Du Pont, the US chemicals company.
