Russian nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky yesterday called on Moscow
to bomb Nato bases in Italy in response to the air strikes on Gorazde. 'They
bomb one town, we bomb another town,' he said in Strasbourg, immediately
before railing against the West in a speech to the 32-nation Council of
Europe, which promotes human rights and democracy.
On his way to the meeting, Mr Zhirinovsky, the leader of Russia's Liberal
Democratic party, hurled stones and spat at a group of Jewish students
protesting against anti-Semitism. Mr Zhirinovsky said he would 'break their
heads'. Report, Page 3
