S&amp;U, the consumer credit group, yesterday said that organic growth was
behind a strong advance in annual profits.
Mr Derek Coombs, chairman, said the 24 per cent improvement at the pre-tax
level - from Pounds 4.52m to Pounds 5.62m - was 'very encouraging' and
achieved without any acquisitions.
Turnover at the Birmingham-based group firmed to Pounds 56.9m (Pounds 53m).
Earnings per share emerged at 33.8p, up from 27.4p, and the recommended
final dividend goes up to 8.9p, bringing the total distribution for the year
to 11.5p, up 15 per cent.
Directors also proposed a 1-for-10 scrip issue.
