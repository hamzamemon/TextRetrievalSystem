France Telecom, the French state-owned telecommunications operator yesterday
announced that it would take an equity stake in General Magic, the US
communications software developer forming an international alliance of
companies to offer products and services for personal messaging and
information retrieval.
The French group is the first European telecommunications company to join
the international technology development partnership. Other members include
Apple Computer, AT&amp;T and Motorola of the US, Sony, Matsushita, NTT, Fujitsu,
and Toshiba of Japan and Philips of the Netherlands. Philips is understood
to have played a significant role in drawing France Telecom into the group.
France Telecom declined to specify the amount it would invest. Like other
partners, however, it is understood to have taken a minority stake and to
have obtained licences to General Magic's software technology.
