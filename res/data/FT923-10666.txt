THE High Court has ordered Pounds 2m to be paid into court for the benefit
of investors in Asset Management, an Isle of Man company that carried on
unauthorised investment business in the UK.
The order for an interim payment was made against the company, Mr Roger
Shrubb, and Financial Centres, on an application by the Securities and
Investments Board.
