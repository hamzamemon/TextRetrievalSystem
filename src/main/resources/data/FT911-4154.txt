League champions Liverpool will be allowed back into European competition
next season, Uefa, European football's governing body, said. English clubs
were banned from Europe in 1985 after 39 people died in rioting at Brussels'
Heysel stadium before the European Cup final between Liverpool and Juventus.
The ban on other English clubs was lifted last year.
