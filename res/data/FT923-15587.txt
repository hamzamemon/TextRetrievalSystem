EALING Studios, the home of such classic films as The Lavender Hill Mob and
Kind Hearts and Coronets, was yesterday sold by the BBC for Pounds 6m. The
studio complex, in west London, has been bought by BBRK, the TV and film
production group. Part of it will be leased to the National Film and
Television School.
