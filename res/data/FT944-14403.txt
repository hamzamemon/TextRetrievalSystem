Societe Europeenne des Satellites, the company that operates the Astra
satellite system, dismissed its director-general, Pierre Meyrat. SES said Mr
Meyrat, a pioneer of satellite television in Europe, had 'been released from
his duties'. The departure is in spite of letters of support from customers.
