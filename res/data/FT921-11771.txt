Because of difficulties in renegotiating satisfactory working capital
facilities with its bankers, Waverley Cameron is raising finance by selling
A&amp;J Partners, its discount stationery subsidiary, for Pounds 3.02m.
It has provisionally agreed the sale to a management-led company, which will
pay Pounds 2.2m on completion and assume the existing property mortgage of
Pounds 820,000.
Waverley said difficulties arose with banks - which effectively withdrew
Pounds 2m of working capital - despite that it reducing borrowings from
Pounds 7.81m since March 31 to Pounds 4.54m, significantly improving the
trading performance of Partners, and integrating and restructuring the
office products activities, thereby making significant savings in operating
costs.
