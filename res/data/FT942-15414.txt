The Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions and Price
Waterhouse - receivers to the Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter - agreed
yesterday to set up a joint working party to consider the company's imminent
problem of reducing its workforce to match its dwindling workload.
Of the remaining 1,038 employees, 490 are at risk of losing their jobs next
month when Swan Hunter hands over the Type 23 frigate HMS Northumberland,
leaving only one frigate in the yard.
The receivers have described the 1,038 as the 'golden nugget' of the
company, which they hope to sell as a going concern. The unions fear that
any further redundancies would eat into the core workforce essential to
Swans' future.
