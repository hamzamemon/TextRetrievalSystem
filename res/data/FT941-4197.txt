A judge has indicted Mr Francisco Macri, billionaire owner of Argentina's
Fiat and Peugeot cars manufacturer, Sevel, on charges of evading Dollars 55m
of tax. The indictment has shocked the local business community and the
Buenos Aires stock exchange. Sevel shares fell 6.7 per cent and traders
predicted the fall-out could hit other companies of Mr Macri's Socma group,
which includes construction, insurance, telecommunications, TV and farming.
