JAPAN Air Lines, the Japanese international carrier which last month
announced a loss for the year to the end of March, yesterday unveiled a
cost-cutting and revenue-boosting programme, writes Stefan Wagstyl in Tokyo.
By increasing income from domestic operations, JAL hopes by the 1996-97
financial year to increase net revenues by Y100bn (Dollars 782m) a year. It
is planning a Y25bn pre-tax profit in 1996-97.
