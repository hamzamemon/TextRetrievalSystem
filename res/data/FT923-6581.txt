The Duchess of York made her first public appearance since the furore broke
over published holiday photographs of her and friend, John Bryan. She and
her two daughters left Balmoral yesterday for her new home in Wentworth,
Berkshire. Buckingham Palace said her departure was 'as planned' before
publication of the photographs.
