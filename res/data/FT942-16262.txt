The French hotels and tourism group will also announce last year's results
on Wednesday. The group, which has been hit by recession and fierce
competition in the international hotels business, has warned that it expects
to show a decline in profits. Estimates of net income range from FFr550m to
FFr650m (Dollars 110m), depending on exceptional items, compared with
FFr802m in 1992.
