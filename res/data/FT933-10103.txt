South Korea yesterday proposed that talks with North Korea on mutual nuclear
inspections be resumed next Tuesday, writes John Burton in Seoul.
It is unclear, however, whether Pyongyang will accept the proposal since
Seoul is suggesting that the talks should be held through the bilateral
Joint Nuclear Control Commission. North Korea wants the talks conducted by
special envoys who would also arrange a summit meeting between the leaders
of the two Koreas.
