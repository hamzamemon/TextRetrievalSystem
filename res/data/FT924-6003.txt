ACCIDENTS and ill health at work can cost businesses up to 37 per cent of
annual profits, a study by the Health and Safety Executive has found.
The study, to be published in the new year, shows company losses through
accidents running at between eight and 36 times the insured costs. The
executive says nine people are killed and 400 badly injured every week at
work.
