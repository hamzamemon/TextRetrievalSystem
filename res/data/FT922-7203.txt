Up to 300 people have been killed in two days of religious and ethnic
fighting in northern Nigeria, according to diplomats in the troubled city of
Kaduna, Reuter reports from Lagos. One diplomat said: 'I saw mortuaries and
hospitals filled with the injured and corpses, some beaten beyond
recognition.'
Police meanwhile arrested Dr Beko Ransome-Kuti, a leading human rights
activist, after he made anti-government remarks.
He is the brother of Mr Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, health minister.
