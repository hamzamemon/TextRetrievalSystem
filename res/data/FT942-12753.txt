The pollution inspectorate yesterday launched an experimental 24-hour
information hotline.
ECOfacts will be available to anyone with a push-button phone and a fax and
will give details on companies' applications to operate potentially
polluting processes, inspectorate guidelines, prosecutions, and other
computer-held data.
The number is 0881 882288, with calls charged at 39p a minute at normal
times, and 25p a minute cheap rate.
