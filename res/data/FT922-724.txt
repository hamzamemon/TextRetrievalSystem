FIVE candidates were announced yesterday for the chairmanship of the
parliamentary Labour party to be vacated by Mr Stan Orme.
In the parallel ballot for chief whip, Mr John Evans, the St Helens North
MP, emerged as the sole challenger to Mr Derek Foster, who has held the post
since 1985.
The close of nominations at noon yesterday now prompts a frantic week of
campaigning for the posts - both ex-officio shadow cabinet seats - with
voting closing next Thursday.
The contestants for the chairmanship are: Mr Robin Corbett (Birmingham
Erdington), Mrs Gwyneth Dunwoody (Crewe and Nantwich), Mr Doug Hoyle
(Warrington North), Mr Allan Rogers (Rhondda) and Mr Ernie Ross (Dundee
West).
