Turkey's privatisation agency is to be restructured as a private company, in
an attempt to insulate the government from criticism before the sale of
state assets, writes John Murray Brown in Ankara. The changes form a key
part of an economic package to be unveiled this weekend following
yesterday's presentation of the new budget to parliament.
More than 120 state companies are to be grouped under this new body, which
will prepare them for sale. Companies affected include THY, the national
airline, cement factories and the Tupras oil refining corporation.
