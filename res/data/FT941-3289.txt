President Clinton has told Congress that he is extending the US moratorium
on nuclear testing until September 1995, the White House said yesterday,
Reuter reports.
White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said the decision was based in part on
the restraint of other declared nuclear powers in not resuming testing in
response to China's test last October. She also credited the encouraging
progress in comprehensive test ban talks since they opened in January.
