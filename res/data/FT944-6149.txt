Memory Corporation, a Scottish company which has developed a new technology
which will lower the cost of producing computer memory products, is coming
to the Stock Exchange in December via a placing which will raise about
Pounds 2m and value the company at some Pounds 20m.
The shares will then move to the Alternative Investment Market when it is
launched next year.
The pathfinder prospectus suggests that turnover will reach Pounds 11m in
1995, and pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.9m.
