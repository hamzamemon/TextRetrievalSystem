Poland yesterday got its fourth prime minister in the three years since the
fall of the communist regime when parliament voted in Mr Waldemar Pawlak, a
32-year-old farmer and head of the PSL farmers' party, as the head of
government, writes Chistopher Bobinksi in Warsaw. Parliament also passed
overwhelmingly a tough, IMF-backed budget, as a first step toward winning
back credits and investment.
