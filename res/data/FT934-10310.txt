Russian president Boris Yeltsin attended a rededication service at the
rebuilt cathedral of Our Lady of Kazan in Red Square, Moscow. The 17th
century church, smashed to the ground in 1936 under Soviet rule, reopened in
red and gold splendour to the peal of bells. The building is a few steps
from the Lenin mausoleum.
