More than doubled pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.27m were announced by
Copymore, the USM-quoted office equipment company, for the year to December
31. In 1992 profits were Pounds 536,000.
Mr Jeff Godbold and Mr Claudio Sarno, joint chairmen, said the result
reflected directors' concentration on expanding the core business of
servicing and supplying copiers, faxes and laser printers.
Turnover rose from Pounds 30.4m to Pounds 35.4m, generating operating
profits of Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 917,000). Earnings per share came through at
7.1p (3.3p). A second interim of 1.5p has been paid.
