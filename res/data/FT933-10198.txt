Norman Lamont, the ex-chancellor of the exchequer and former Master of the
Royal Mint, may be free from the cares of office but his problems persist.
Only this week he was reported on the train from Norwich trying to buy a cup
of coffee with old 10p pieces.
Seems a bit of a liberty for a man who ordered that the coins would no
longer be legal tender after the end of June.
