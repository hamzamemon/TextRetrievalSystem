Sears, the UK retailer, is set to achieve its long-held ambitions to break
into the continental European mail order market with the purchase of ter
Meulen Post of the Netherlands for less than Pounds 5m.
The UK group's mail order division, Freemans, is in the final stages of
negotiations for the loss-making Dutch mail order house. A deal is likely to
be completed within two months.
Last year ter Meulen Post reported sales of Pounds 33m.
