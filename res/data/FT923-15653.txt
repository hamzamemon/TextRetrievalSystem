DEVON Systems International, the financial systems company, is to acquire
ICCH Financial Markets (IFM), the software development arm of ICCH, formerly
the International Commodities Clearing House.
The deal will create the world's largest firm specialising in derivatives
software, according to IFM.
The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of July. The terms,
which involve a purchase of assets rather than shares, have not been
disclosed. Devon will honour all existing IFM support and timesharing
arrangements.
ICCH has developed a number of new products, including its new FORTE back
office system, which will be combined with Devon Exchange Windows, an
advanced facility for real-time modelling and trading of futures and
options.
