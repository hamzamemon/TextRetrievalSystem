There is nothing like a currency crisis to stimulate the creative juices of
the the City's top economic brains. In just two days the team of scribblers
at BZW has come up with 'Eurassic Park', 'Day of Wreckoning' and 'tERMinal'.
However, this week's booby prize must go to Morgan Stanley, which used to be
a haven of fine writing. Its circular is entitled: 'Fallout from
ChernobERM'. Ugh.
