Higher costs for redundancies and reorganisation have eaten into the profit
at AF Bulgin, maker of electrical and electronic components.
After the costs of Pounds 114,000 (Pounds 93,000), pre-tax profit fell from
Pounds 57,000 to Pounds 32,000 in the six months ended July 31 1992.
Earnings per share were 0.11p (0.16p).
Turnover in the period improved from Pounds 6.57m to Pounds 6.58m.
New products were being brought forward and the directors were encouraged by
the response to the Mini-Buccaneer range of compact water proof connectors.
