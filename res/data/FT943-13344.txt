Simon Berry, 36, has been appointed to the board of Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, one
of the UK's most well-known independent wine and spirits merchants. Berry
will continue working as the company's marketing director for the wine
division.
He is the seventh generation of the Berry family in the company, which has
remained independent and family-owned since 1698. He joined the company in
1977, first in the cellars and then in the original St James's shop, where
he was responsible for managing wine sales to the City.
Berry has spent all his working life in the wine business since leaving
school in 1975. His first employment was with Deinhard &amp; Co, shippers of
German wines, before moving to Moet et Chandon in Epernay, where he gave
wine tours to visitors.
He became Berry Bros &amp; Rudd's marketing manager in 1983, moving up to
marketing director in 1987. Recently he has been closely involved in
establishing the company's duty free shop at Heathrow airport, which opened
last month.
