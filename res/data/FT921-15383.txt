Belgium's biggest cement company, CBR, yesterday criticised the European
Commission's investigation into alleged price-rigging by European producers
as showing a 'limited understanding' of the industry, writes Andrew Baxter.
The Commission has written to 76 European cement producers and organisations
claiming breaches of competition law in the 1980s. In line with EC rules,
the producers have two months to provide explanations.
