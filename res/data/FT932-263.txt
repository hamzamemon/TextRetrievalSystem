ENI, the Italian state energy group, will return to profits this year,
although the situation was too uncertain for a precise forecast, said Mr
Franco Bernabe, managing director, Reuter reports from Brindisi. The group
ended 1992 with a consolidated net loss of L815bn (Dollars 530m) after
making a net profit of L1,100bn in 1991.
