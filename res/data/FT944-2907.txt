Hungary's privatisation authorities yesterday backed down and agreed to sell
a 51 per cent stake in the country's last state-owned hotel chain to
American General Hospitality, a privately-held US hotel management group.
AGH won the right to negotiate for HungarHotels last month but talks broke
down between the company and the privatisation body, after a last-minute
price increase and political pressure to hand over the group to the
cash-strapped social security fund.
