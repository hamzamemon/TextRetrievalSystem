RETAILERS are increasingly likely to penetrate each other's markets and move
into non-traditional areas in the competitive era after the recession, a
report by Manchester Business School and Cambridge Econometrics says.
The report, on prospects for UK retailing until 2005, says sales growth in
the sector has failed to keep pace with consumer spending. Discretionary
spending has been directed at leisure activities and at goods and services
not traditionally supplied through retail outlets.
