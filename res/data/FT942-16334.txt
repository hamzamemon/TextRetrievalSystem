Progress at RMC, the world's largest concrete company, is thought to have
been slow, with 1993 profits little higher than the Pounds 166.6m earned in
1992. It reports on Wednesday. Blue Circle, the UK's largest cement group,
is expected on Thursday to announce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 155m, up
from Pounds 93.8m.
