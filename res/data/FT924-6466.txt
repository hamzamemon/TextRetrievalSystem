The German government and opposition hope to reach agreement this year on
new rules to curb the flood of would-be immigrants, party leaders said
yesterday.
They agreed to hold two days of talks to thrash out a compromise later this
month.
The move has been made possible by this week's agreement within the
opposition Social Democrats (SPD) to accept constitutional amendments on the
right to political asylum.
