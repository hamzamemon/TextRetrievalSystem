Sir William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, was paid Pounds 1.06m last
year, a slight increase on the Pounds 1.04m he received in 1992. The bank's
pre-tax profits for 1993 rose by 94 per cent to Pounds 1.7bn.
The bank said in its annual accounts that total directors' emoluments rose
from Pounds 3.8m in 1992 to Pounds 4.8m. It added that Sir William's
emoluments for part of 1993 included expatriate benefits which formed 'a
significant portion' of the sum.
