J. P. MORGAN, the leader of a banking syndicate that last month said it
would foreclose on part of a Dollars 160m loan to Olympia &amp; York, yesterday
postponed a planned auction of O&amp;Y assets until June 18.
The postponement of the auction - of an interest rate swap that had been
pledged by O&amp;Y as collateral on the Dollars 160m loan - was seen in New York
as a possible indication that the bank group and O&amp;Y were negotiating a
possible settlement.
J. P. Morgan has been in an uncomfortable position ever since it announced
the auction, which was first set for May 22 and then delayed until
yesterday. This is because the New York bank is both a financial adviser to
O&amp;Y and a creditor with an estimated Dollars 50m of total loan exposure to
the developer.
O&amp;Y, which is in technical default on several New York mortgage loans, is
struggling to keep its US properties out of bankruptcy court. The group
needs at least Dollars 30m of cash above and beyond its present US income
stream if it is to service its debt obligations and avoid the need to file
for protection from US creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law.
The possible settlement being discussed with the J. P. Morgan-led bank
syndicate could involve O&amp;Y making a payment on the Dollars 160m outstanding
loan.
