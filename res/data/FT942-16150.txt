New York-based Shearman &amp; Sterling has opened an office in Hong Kong, the
latest in a long list of US and UK firms to seek a foothold in south-east
Asia. The new office will be staffed by eight full-time resident attorneys,
three of whom have defected from the Hong Kong office of Los Angeles's
Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher.
