THE TWO defendants in the second Blue Arrow fraud trial have reversed their
decision to represent themselves in court and have reinstated their lawyers,
John Mason writes.
That follows a decision by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, which employs the defendants
 -Mr Paul Smallwood and Mr Tim Brown - to pay the income-tax liabilities of
both men as well as their legal fees.
Those liabilities - which may approach Pounds 400,000 for each man - arise
from the Inland Revenue's decision to treat P&amp;D's payment of their legal
fees as a benefit in kind. Mr Smallwood and Mr Brown are both charged with
conspiracy to defraud.
