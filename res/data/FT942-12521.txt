Price Waterhouse yesterday won its legal fight to block plans by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants to begin a disciplinary inquiry into the
accountancy firm's conduct as auditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International.
The Lords yesterday dismissed an application by the institute for leave to
challenge a Court of Appeal court decision preventing the inquiry starting
until after settlement of civil claims against Price Waterhouse by the BCCI
liquidators.
