GREECE'S former deputy prime minister, Mr Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas, a
defendant in the Bank of Crete embezzlement trial, died in hospital
yesterday, eight days after suffering a stroke while questioning a witness,
writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
Mr Koutsogiorgas, who was 69, was accused of accepting a Dollars 2m bribe
from the bank's owner in 1988 in return for introducing legislation on bank
secrecy. The trial, adjourned after Mr Koutsogiorgas collapsed in the
courtroom, can now continue. But without his testimony, it appears
increasingly unlikely that Mr Andreas Papandreou, the former prime minister,
could be convicted.
