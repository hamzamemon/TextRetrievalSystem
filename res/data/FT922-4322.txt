THE New Zealand government yesterday announced the sale of NZDollars 500m
(USDollars 269m) worth of mortgages on state-owned homes, marking a
significant withdrawal of government support for people on low incomes,
writes Terry Hall in Wellington.
The government is selling a tranche of mortgages to Postbank, a subsidiary
of the ANZ Bank, and the Mortgage Corporation of New Zealand. They are to
buy some 20,000 mortgages between them, each paying NZDollars 250m.
The government said it was open to offers for the remaining mortgages held
by the state-owned Housing Corporation. It said all that had been sold were
prime rate mortgages charging market interest rates.
