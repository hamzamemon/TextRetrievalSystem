While on the subject of adverts, the New Zealand Immigration Service has
been thrilled by the response to its latest bid to boost its population by
poaching settlers from the Old Country.
Last year New Zealand granted residence to just over a thousand cases from
the UK. After the first three weeks of its latest call for recruits, in a
Financial Times' advertisement, it has received four times that number in
phone calls alone.
The surprise is not so much that 27 per cent of the responses came from the
formerly prosperous south-east, but that so many FT readers are thinking of
chucking it all in. After all the NZ economy is only starting to show the
first glimmerings of revival after eight years.
