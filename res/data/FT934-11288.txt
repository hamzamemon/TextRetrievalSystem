The Wall Street securities house Kidder, Peabody has agreed to keep its
headquarters and 3,000 employees in New York city in return for Dollars 31m
in tax incentives from the municipal government, writes Patrick Harverson.
The decision was a victory for the city's mayor, Mr David Dinkins, as the
loss of Kidder would have been a blow to the city's shrinking tax base, its
fragile morale and the mayor's re-election hopes.
