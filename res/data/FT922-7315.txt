MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, has warned that there will inevitably
be 'fallout' among electronics companies operating in Scotland because of
technological change and recession, James Buxton writes.
His warning echoes widely held fears in Scotland that Silicon Glen, as the
Scottish electronics industry is sometimes known, is vulnerable to the
changes sweeping the computer world. 'There has to be fallout among some of
the electronics industry in Scotland as a consequence of the changes that
have taken place,' Mr Lang said.
The world computer industry is in turmoil as advances in microprocessor
technology have reduced the cost to new companies of entering the industry,
while demand in many markets has slowed.
