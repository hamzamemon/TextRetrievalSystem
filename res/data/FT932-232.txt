Supporters of the self-declared winner of Nigeria's presidential election
are calling a general strike to protest against the military's decision to
scrap the poll, Reuter reports from Lagos. 'There is a possibility of a
general strike this week. It is just a matter of time,' said Mr Fred Eko,
aide to Mr Moshood Abiola, candidate for the Social Democratic party.
