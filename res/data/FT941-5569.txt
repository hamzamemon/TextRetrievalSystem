A squeeze together with continued strength in bonds helped stock index
futures rally from early weakness, as a volatile week in derivatives came to
a close, writes Joel Kibazo.
At the official close, the March Liffe contract on the FT-SE 100 stood at
3,272, having fallen as low as 3,225 on selling from US houses. Volume was
11,801 lots. The mid-250 contract for the same month traded 289 lots.
Volume in traded options was 38,539 contracts, with 16,139 dealt in the
FT-SE index option and 2,324 in Glaxo.
