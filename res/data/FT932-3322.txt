LABOUR WILL today use the second day's scrutiny of the government's new
insider dealing legislation to press ministers over the prosecution of City
crime.
Mr Alistair Darling, the party's City spokesman, will call for the
government to consider setting up a 'streamlined, independent organisation'
responsible for prosecuting City crime. 'There is a strong feeling that
there are too many cooks spoiling the broth,' he said.
