A legal secretary with Baker and Mackenzie, a City law firm, has been
awarded about Pounds 40,000 in compensation and damages after suffering
repetitive strain injury at work.
The case brought by Ms Adelle Smith in the Mayor's and City of London County
Court is one of the first settled in court since the High Court rejected a
claim by a Reuters journalist in October. Judge John Prosser said then that
RSI had 'no place in the medical books'.
