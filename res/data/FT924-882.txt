THE occupation of the former Lyons Maid factory at Kirkby, Merseyside, has
ended with an agreement that the workers can try to keep the business going
as a co-operative.
Nestle UK, which acquired the business from the receiver, agreed to assist
in setting up the co-operative and has donated the plant's equipment.
