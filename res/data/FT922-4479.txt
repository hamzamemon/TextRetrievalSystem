The sale of Cardwise, a small credit card protection company formerly owned
by the Access banks, is to be probed by the Office of Fair Trading.
The prospective buyer is believed to be Credit Card Sentinel, the largest
player in the UK card protection market.
Cardwise is owned by First Data Resources, the credit card processing arm of
American Express. Sentinel is the European offshoot of Datacard Corporation
of Minneapolis.
