LEADING creditors of Daiichi, the Japanese real estate company facing
financial difficulties, have agreed to forego interest on loans to aid the
restructuring of the group.
Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking, Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking, Nippon Credit Bank, and Chuo
Trust &amp; Banking will waive until March 1995 the 3 per cent interest on total
debts of Y300bn (Dollars 2.8bn).
The waiver is expected to ease Daiichi's debt burden by about Y9bn a year.
The move will hit the banks, which face mounting bad loans.
In March last year, the four banks lowered interest rates on loans to
Daiichi, which has some Y550bn in total debt. Daiichi plans to ask other
creditors to lower interest to 0.5 per cent.
