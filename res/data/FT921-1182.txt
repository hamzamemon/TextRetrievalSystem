THE Semiconductor Manufacturers Association said yesterday that whoever won
the election needed to understand the importance of encouraging industry to
invest in training and research and development.
Mr Ken Sanders, managing director of Texas Instruments, the US semiconductor
manufacturer, said that a Conservative plan requiring employers who poached
a worker to compensate the other company for its investment in training did
not address the lack of training in the UK.
He said the government should also encourage wider adoption of common
standards to raise the effectiveness of industry.
The association also noted that it had started to see the first signs of
recovery in the past three to four months, with some members reporting
business levels exceeding those of any period since 1988.
