AXA, one of France's largest insurance groups, has increased its wine
interests by buying control of Chateau Suduiraut, one of the best-known
sources of Sauternes wine, in a deal worth around FFr108m (Dollars 20m).
Chateau Suduiraut, a 17th century castle at Preignac in the Gironde region
of south-west France, produces one of France's most famous Sauternes.
The chateau, in which Axa is acquiring a 51 per cent stake, has an estate of
200 hectares, of which 88 are in production.
