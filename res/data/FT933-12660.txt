The US became the largest seller of arms to the third world last year, while
the overall sales of armaments to that market decreased, Aaron Lewis reports
from Washington.
A study by the Congressional Research Service said the US was responsible
for 57 per cent, compared with Russia's 9 per cent.
Worldwide weapons sales reflected Russia's reduced performance totalling
only Dollars 23.9bn last year, Dollars 4.7bn less than in 1991.
The third world, in particular, has imported fewer weapons in the wake of
the dissolution of the Soviet Union. This affected in particular Vietnam,
Cuba and Syria.
