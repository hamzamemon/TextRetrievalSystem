Scottish &amp; Newcastle has announced a Pounds 12m reorganisation of its
production plant in a move designed to improve operational efficiency.
The brewer is to transfer one of its two high-speed canning lines from the
Fountain brewery, Edinburgh, to its Royal brewery, Manchester, where it will
be better placed to supply the take-home drinks trade.
A new Pounds 7.5m bottling line will be installed on the vacated site in
Edinburgh to cope with demand for the company's bottled beers.
