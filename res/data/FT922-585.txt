FORMER British Coal managers including Mr Malcolm Edwards, who resigned as
commercial director this year, are lobbying for a separate coal corporation
in Scotland after the industry's privatisation. The Royal Bank of Scotland
yesterday confirmed that Lord Younger, its chairman, had met a group of
former managers and union representatives for 'exploratory discussions'.
