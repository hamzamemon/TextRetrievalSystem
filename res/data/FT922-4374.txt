CHANGES introduced by Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, will provide
the basis for further competition in the UK industry, according to Sir Bryan
Carsberg, director-general of telecommunications.
Sir Bryan, who is expected to take up his post as head of the Office of Fair
Trading this month, says in Oftel's annual report that he expects greater
competition particularly in mobile communications and cable.
