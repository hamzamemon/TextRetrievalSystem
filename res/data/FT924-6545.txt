David Cicurel, currently the French chairman of International Media
Communications, the USM-quoted video products and soft drinks company, is to
be appointed the new chairman of International Communication &amp; Data,
following the enforced retirement through ill-health of the incumbent, Nigel
Balcombe.
Daniel Unger, interim chairman of ICD, says IMC had agreed to provide
Cicurel's services to ICD in return for an option to subscribe for 6.95m
ordinary ICD shares (12.2 per cent of its equity) exercisable within three
years at 7p apiece.
USM-quoted ICD supplies names, addresses and information to the direct
mail/direct marketing industry.
