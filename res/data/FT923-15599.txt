BELLING, the cooker maker that went into receivership in May, has been sold
as a going concern to Southampton-based Dimplex (UK), an electric-appliances
company.
KPMG Peat Marwick, the Belling receiver, said it had also agreed the sale of
the assets of Compound Engineering, a Belling subsidiary in Burnley,
Lancashire.
