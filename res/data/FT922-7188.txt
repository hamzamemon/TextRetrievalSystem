THE prime minister yesterday reaffirmed his commitment to reforming the
procedures and hours of Commons sittings.
He told the House the government planned an early debate on a report from a
Commons select committee which proposes a radical shake-up MPs' working
practices, drastically curtailing the number of very late night sittings.
Mr Major said: 'My personal belief is that this House does need reform of
its procedures and I hope we will be able to proceed to it as speedily as
possible.'
