Castle Mill International, the clothing and gifts group, has warned there
would be a significant loss for the year when it reports 1991 results in
April.
The second half had been hit by a difficult trading climate and the run down
of both the children's clothing business and the leisurewear business of
Force Sportive resulting in stock losses and closure costs.
The group swung from losses of Pounds 88,555 to profits of Pounds 313,861
pre-tax for 1990.
