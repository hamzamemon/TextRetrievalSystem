Sunset + Vine, the television production company, is buying Mobile Image,
the outside broadcast facilities group, for Pounds 2m cash from National
Broadcasting Company of the US.
As part of the deal Mobile will be contracted to supply facilities for NBC
European sports coverage.
In the year to December 31 Mobile reported operating profits of Pounds
152,000 (Pounds 57,000) before non-recurring items and a Pounds 75,000 bad
debt charge. Turnover was Pounds 3.02m (Pounds 3.25m). Net assets were
Pounds 1.71m.
Sunset said that broadcasters were increasingly contracting out the coverage
of sporting events and the purchase would strengthen its ability to tender
for these.
