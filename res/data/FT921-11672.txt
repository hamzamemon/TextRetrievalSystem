BRITISH COAL yesterday announced that 128 jobs are to go at Easington
colliery, Co Durham, following talks with the mining unions.
The pit, one of only five left in north-east England, has made a loss of
more than Pounds 4m since April. British Coal said the job losses would
reduce manpower at the colliery to 1,350.
