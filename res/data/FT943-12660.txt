Derivatives markets led the UK stock market ahead yesterday as firmness in
the US dollar strengthened confidence across markets in Europe, writes Terry
Byland. Trading volume in the September contract on the FT-SE 100 Index was
moderate, with a final total of 12,237 including deals conducted after
official hours. The contract remained at a good premium to cash throughout,
closing at 3,127, a premium of about 13 points. On Monday, the fair value
premium, calculated solely in terms of ex-dividend changes, comes down to
around 9 points.
