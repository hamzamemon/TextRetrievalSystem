EFM Japan Trust, which was launched in June, saw its net assets value reach
117.58p at November 30.
After allowing for initial launch costs the figure showed a growth of 22 per
cent over the period from June 8. In part the improvement reflected
sterling's weakness relative to the yen.
Gross income in the period came to Pounds 125,000 and earnings worked
through at 0.61p.
