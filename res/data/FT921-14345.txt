SIR PATRICK MAYHEW, the attorney-general, argued in the High Court in London
yesterday that three former policemen in the Surrey force should be made to
stand trial on charges of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice
arising out of the 1974 Guildford Four pub bombings case.
Charges against the men were dismissed last year by the metropolitan
stipendiary magistrate on the ground that they would not receive a fair
trial.
