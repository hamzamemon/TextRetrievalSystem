POHJOLA, Finland's biggest insurance group, suffered an operating loss of
FM105m (Dollars 26.2m) in the first half of the year, it reported yesterday.
It made a FM1m profit for the same period of 1991. Net investment income
dropped to FM234m from FM317m.
The group said it would make a further loss this year. It blamed its
first-half deficit on 'the unfavourable development of foreign and domestic
credit insurance, unrealised losses on investments and the still low level
of realised gains'.
The group is affected by the wider Nordic insurance company crisis that has
hit Uni Storebrand and Hafnia Holdings. With a 10 per cent stake in Skandia,
Sweden's severely troubled insurance conglomerate, Pohjola faces further
uncertainty in the coming months.
