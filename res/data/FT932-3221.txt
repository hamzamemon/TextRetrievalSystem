MARRIOTT Corporation, the US hotels and food services group, is to take a
Dollars 32m charge against its second-quarter earnings. The provision is to

sale', writes Nikki Tait in New York.
Marriott said the after-tax, non-cash charge followed discussions with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
