The government yesterday fiercely denied suggestions that it was
politicising the 50th anniversary of D-Day to maximise its vote in the
European elections in June.
Downing Street said: 'The idea that Operation Overlord was launched 50 years
ago to help the Conservatives win the European elections in 1994 is
ridiculous.' The prime minister was said to be confident that the government
had struck the right balance 'of seriousness and fun' in commemorating
D-Day.
