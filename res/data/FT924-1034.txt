UNION CARBIDE, the Connecticut-based chemicals group, said it had sold about
Dollars 150m of non-strategic assets this year as part of its goal of
disposing of Dollars 500m worth of assets by the end of 1993.
Mr Robert Kennedy, chairman of Union Carbide, said the 1992 asset sales
included the company's investment in Exel Limited, a casualty insurance
company; and Carbide's interests in Kemet Electronics and in a Canadian
financial
trust.
Mr Kennedy said that talks were still under way with prospective buyers of
Carbide's Organo Silicon business, a division that makes fluids and
chemicals used in fibreglass, reinforced plastics, textiles, coatings,
automotive adhesives and other specialty markets.
The Union Carbide chairman, in a year-end letter to employees, called 1992
one of the toughest in memory.
