Sir, I read with interest the article on welfare benefits by Julian Le Grand
(Personal View, May 24) in which he states: 'We estimate that over their
lifetimes people pay for between two-thirds and three-quarters of the
benefits they receive from social security, education and health.'
I look forward with even greater interest to a follow-up article explaining
who pays the rest.
