Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the head of the Left Democratic Alliance, the
former communist partner in the ruling coalition, moved yesterday to defuse
a clash with President Lech Walesa over his right to veto ministerial
appointments. Mr Kwasniewski told the president that his group would drop
its proposed constitutional amendment empowering parliament to overrule the
presidential veto. The president had threatened to call new elections should
the constitution be changed.
