LABOUR and the Conservatives are collaborating in a 'tax is bad' campaign
which will hinder future social provision by the government, Mr Des Wilson,
the Liberal Democrats' campaign director, complained last night.
Liberal Democrats backed a one penny increase in the basic rate of income
tax to fund Pounds 2bn extra spending on education because 'it's the best
investment we can make', he said in a speech in Aylesbury.
Mr Wilson said Labour had lost its traditional understanding of the value
electors placed on the use of tax for developing transport infrastructure,
education and health service. The Liberal Democrats have embarked on the
risky strategy of focusing on their education plans in the belief that there
is support for higher taxes for public services.
