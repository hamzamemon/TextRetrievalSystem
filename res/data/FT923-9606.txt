Pepe, the jeans designer and distributor, has postponed for three months the
payment of its preference dividend while it comes to a decision over the
issuing of new equity.
In June it warned that the ordinary dividend would be passed.
Mr Joe Sinyor, chief executive, said that he expected the company to decide
within three months which route it would use to issue more shares.
