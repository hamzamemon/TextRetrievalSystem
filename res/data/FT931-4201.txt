Gesamtmetall, Germany's employers' association for the metal and electrical
industry, yesterday said any wage increases in east Germany must reflect
productivity levels and must be kept below the 11.5 per cent annual
inflation rate in the five eastern states, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
At the same time, Mr Dieter Kirchner, head of Gesamtmetall, repeated his
offer to resume talks with the union, IG Metall, aimed at preventing a
strike in the east called for April 1.
