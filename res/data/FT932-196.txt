SIR ROY WATTS, chairman of Thames Water, was frail, tired and thinking of
retirement in the days before his death, an inquest was told.
Mr Michael Hoffman, group chief executive, told Poplar coroner's court, east
London, that Sir Roy, 67, had told him he was suffering from Parkinson's
disease some months before his body was found in the River Thames in London
on May 4.
Dr Douglas Chambers, coroner, recorded an open verdict.
