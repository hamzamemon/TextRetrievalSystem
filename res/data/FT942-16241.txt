Poland yesterday urged the US to play a more active role in central Europe.
Speaking during a visit to Warsaw by Mr Strobe Talbott, US deputy secretary
of state, President Lech Walesa complained that the European Union and Nato
were not expanding eastwards. 'No great structural changes have been made
and life cannot stand a vacuum,' he said, implying that only Russia stood to
gain from the west's cautious stance. Mr Talbott met Polish leaders to
discuss the country's membership in the Partnership for Peace security
programme.
