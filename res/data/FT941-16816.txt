Schindler Holding, the Swiss lift and rolling-stock maker, confirmed a
profit forecast in a local newspaper although the forecast was not
specifically stated by the company's chief executive, Reuter reports from
Ebikon.
The forecast of a profit rise of at least 30 per cent was 'a confirmed
interpretation of earlier company statements about a significant profit
rise,' the company said.
