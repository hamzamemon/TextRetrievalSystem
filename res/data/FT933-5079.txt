Mexico has approved the charters of five new commercial banks in an attempt
to increase competition in the nation's recently privatised banking system,
writes David Luhnow in Mexico City. The new banks are Banco Inbursa, Banco
Promotor del Norte, Banco Interacciones, Banco Quadrum and Banco Mifel. All
except Banco Promotor del Norte are eyeing the nationwide market.
