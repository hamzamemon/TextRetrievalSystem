Mr Carlos Melancia, former governor of Portugal's Asian colony of Macao, was
acquitted of corruption charges by a Portuguese court yesterday, Reuter
reports from Lisbon. It was the first major corruption trial of a political
figure in Portugal since the dictatorship ended in 1974.
The state prosecutor said she would appeal against the majority verdict by
two of three trial judges.
