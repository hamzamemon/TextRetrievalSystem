Italian police were last night investigating a break-in at the offices of
the Senate Commission looking into the affair of Italy's Banco Nazionale di
Lavoro (BNL) and unauthorised loans made by its Atlanta US branch to Iraq,
writes Robert Graham, in Rome.
Mr Massimo Riva, the independent left parliamentarian who is vice-president
of the Commission, said intruders spent several hours examining a mass of
sensitive documents.
