The presidents of two South Korean commercial banks will be dismissed by the
government in response to a new financial scandal, the country's finance
minister said yesterday, writes John Burton in Seoul.
The action to sack the heads of the Bank of Seoul and Donghwa Bank followed
the arrest on Monday of Ms Chang Young-ja, a relative of former President
Chun Doo-hwan, on fraud charges.
