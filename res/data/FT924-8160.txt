MIRROR Group Newspapers said yesterday that Mr Bill Hagerty, editor of The
People, had 'vacated the editorship'.
Mirror Group said a successor would be appointed soon. No explanation was
given for the change at the top of the Sunday newspaper, which comes two
weeks after the arrival of Mr David Montgomery, former editor of both the
News of the World and Today, as chief executive of the group.
