The prospect of an early election was raised in Poland yesterday when Mr
Waldemar Pawlak, prime minister-designate, told parliament he would resign

crisis came when Mr Pawlak, 32, leader of the Peasant party, who was
designated premier less than a month ago, found himself all but abandoned by
three key parties with which he had hoped to form a government.
