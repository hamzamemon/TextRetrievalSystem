A delegation from the City of London begins a two-day visit to Beirut on
Monday to promote British financial services. The visit is organised by
British Invisibles, a group promoting UK trade, which last week ran a
similar trip to Russia coinciding with the Queen's visit. The delegation is
headed by Mr John Manser, chairman of Robert Fleming - soon to open an
office in Beirut - and includes representatives from the London Stock
Exchange, Schroeder Asseily, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Samuel Montagu, Morgan
Grenfell, Baring International Finance and Credit Lyonnais Rouse. Mr George
Asseily, a Lebanese-born director of Schroeder Asseily, says the Lebanese
government could be aiming to raise up to Dollars 800m on international
markets over the next year.
