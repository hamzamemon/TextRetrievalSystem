Enterprise Zones have earned a reprieve from the Revenue. These are 25-year
investments but sponsors of enterprise zone trusts have been able to provide
an exit to private investors much sooner through the sale of a lesser
interest. In January, the government threatened to disallow this but last
week relaxed the rule, so that investors would be able to leave after seven
years. Johnson Fry, Matrix Securities and Capital Ventures have announced
new EZT launches in the wake of the Inland Revenue's new measure.
