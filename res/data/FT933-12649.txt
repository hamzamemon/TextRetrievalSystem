LEADERS of firefighters yesterday stepped up their opposition to the
government's 1.5 per cent public-sector pay limit with a decision to recall
their union's annual delegate to confirm rejection of the offer and decide
whether or not to take strike action.
The Fire Brigades Union's executive council has rejected the offer and wants
its long-standing pay formula to be honoured.
