Mr Lilley yesterday confirmed that the government would be pushing ahead
with plans to combat benefit fraud by introducing swipe cards with which
welfare payments could be withdrawn.
Mr Lilley told MPs in a statement to the Commons that the government would
launch a computerised system for benefit payments in 1996.
The new system will be partly funded by private-sector capital and will mean
strengthening the post office network. Mr Lilley said nine companies had
submitted proposals to be prime contractors for the system.
He said: 'The card we choose must be easy and acceptable to use, especially
for pensioners.'
He also announced that the government would press ahead with plans to reduce
fraud by improving co-ordination between different local authorities.
