BURMA'S military junta has ordered university and college teachers to take
courses in enforcing discipline after renewed student protests last year,
Reuter reports from Bangkok.
Major General Khin Nyunt, the military intelligence chief, said the courses
were to teach patriotism, support for the junta's policies and how to
maintain good behaviour among students.
Rangoon students demonstrated last month, calling for democracy and release
of Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. The junta then closed colleges
and universities throughout the country.
