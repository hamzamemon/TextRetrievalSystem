Thomas Cook, the UK's third largest travel agency, has paid an undisclosed
sum for the outstanding 49 per cent stake in Thomas Cook Australia, the
joint venture with Qantas Airways established in 1986.
Thomas Cook, now owned by Westdeutsche Landesbank and LTU, the German travel
group, said the deal would give it greater flexibility within the
Asia-Pacific region.
