The Duke of Marlborough won the right to stop his son, the Marquess of
Blandford taking control of the family estate of Blenheim when he succeeds
to the title. The legal ruling allows the Duke to hand responsibility for
the estate, valued at more than Pounds 100m, to trustees. A statement said
the aim of the legal action was not to disinherit Lord Blandford, who in
1986 was jailed for three months for drug offences, but to protect the
estate.
