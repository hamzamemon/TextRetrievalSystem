SIR BRIAN Jenkins, the lord mayor of London, last night called for
co-operation between existing borough councils rather than the creation of a
new authority for the whole capital. He said he opposed calls to establish a
'mayor for London'.
He told leaders of councils and voluntary bodies from across the capital
that partnership, not legislation, should be the way forward.
