In line with its strategy to expand its non-automotive activities, Laird
Group has acquired Equator Wheels &amp; Sections, a manufacturer of metal
spacers and reinforcers for windows and doors, for Pounds 8.8m cash.
Mr Ian Arnott, managing director, said EWS would be integrated into the
security systems division, which with the acquisition will comprise 10
companies in the building products sector in the UK and the US.
In 1992 Equator Wheels made sales of Pounds 13.7m and is expected to beat
this figure for 1993. Profits before interest and tax in 1992 were Pounds
1.2m.
