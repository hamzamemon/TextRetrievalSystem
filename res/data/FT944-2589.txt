Mr Kerry Packer's Darling Casino consortium yesterday started legal
proceedings against the Casino Control Authority's decision to award
Sydney's ADollars 1bn plus casino licence to its rival, the Sydney Harbour
Casino (SHC) joint venture. Darling Casino (DCL), which includes Circus
Circus, the large US gaming group, was outbid for the development rights
earlier this year by SHC. But - questions were raised about Showboat's
probity and a public inquiry was set up.
