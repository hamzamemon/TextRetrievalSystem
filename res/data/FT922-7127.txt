AMERICAN Express Receivables Financing has filed with the US Securities and
Exchange Commission to securitise certain of its credit card receivables,
Reuters reports from New York.
The deal will be the first by the company, part of the American Express
group.
American Express said its Lehman Bros brokerage unit would serve as
underwriter for any securitisation transaction.
Revolving credit receivables excluded from the proposed deal are American
Express' Optima credit card, an American Express spokeswoman said.
