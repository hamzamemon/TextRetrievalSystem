POULTRY farmers were cheated out of thousands of pounds in compensation for
chickens they were forced to slaughter during the 1980s salmonella scare, a
committee of MPs said yesterday.
They accused the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food of deliberately
short-changing the farmers in an act of 'maladministration that should never
be repeated'.
The select committee for the parliamentary ombudsman said ministers had set
compensation 'at the lowest levels legally defensible'.
