British Prime Minister John Major will attend the Barcelona Olympics on
Friday and Saturday, partly to push Manchester's bid to stage the Games in
the year 2000, British officials said.
Major, a keen sports fan, will also assess the kind of services a city must
provide when playing host to the Olympics. Major will meet Juan Samaranch,
President of the International Olympic Committee, as well as the Barcelona
organisers and members of the British team.
The officials conceded that last week's withdrawal of three British Olympic
team members because they had failed drug tests might affect Britain's
chances of staging the Olympics.
Beijing, Berlin, Braslia, Sydney, Milan, Istanbul and Tashkent are also
bidding to host the 2000 Games.
