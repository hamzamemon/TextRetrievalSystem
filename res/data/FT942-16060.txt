James Hardie Industries, the Australian building supplies group, has
continued to sell non-core businesses, with plans to float its electronic
components subsidiary, HarTec, writes Bruce Jacques.
Hardie announced yesterday it would offer 29.1m shares at ADollars 1 each in
the company, with the issue fully underwritten. With payment of
inter-company loans before the float, Hardie will net ADollars 34.1m from
the transaction.
Hardie's managing director, Dr Keith Barton, said the sale was part of the
company's strategy of concentrating on core businesses.
About 35 per cent of HarTec's shares will be set aside for Hardie
shareholders.
