A German diplomat describes how, in a conversation with one of his French
opposite numbers, he recently queried France's tactics over the Gatt
negotiations - where Gallic intransigence has been stiffened by the
Socialist government's worries about the March general elections.
'Why are you so worried about the elections?' the German asked. 'You've lost
them anyway.' To which came the reply, with appropriate hauteur: 'France
never loses elections.'
