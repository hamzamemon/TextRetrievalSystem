Martin Lee, head of Hong Kong's United Democrats party, whose call for more
democracy in the colony is opposed by China, links hands with Anthony
Cheung, head of the Meeting Point party yesterday after announcing they will
join to form the Democratic party, write Simon Holberton in Hong Kong and
Reuter. The move marks a realignment of Hong Kong's pro-democracy groups
with the new party commanding 17 seats in the Legislative Council, making it
the largest in the 60-member parliament. The merger consolidates support for
Governor Chris Patten's pro-democracy legislation.
