Amtrak, US public sector train operator, is to axe about 5,500 jobs and shed
21 per cent of its passenger service to try to eliminate a projected Dollars
200m (Pounds 128.2m) current-year deficit. Thomas Downs, Amtrak president,
said the rising deficit and shrinking ticket sales meant the system could no
longer afford to maintain service to 540 US cities.
