Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive of Caradon, the building products group,
received a bonus of Pounds 246,000 in 1993, taking his remuneration to
Pounds 538,000, up from Pounds 369,000 in 1992 when his bonus was Pounds
77,000, writes Maggie Urry
The bonus reflected the Pounds 100.3m profit Caradon made on selling its
25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox, the packaging group, which resulted
in a doubling of earnings per share including the exceptional profit.
Mr Jansen's basic salary rose from Pounds 291,000 to Pounds 312,000, while
his pension contributions were unchanged at Pounds 156,000.
