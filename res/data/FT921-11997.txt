MALAYAN Cement, the Malaysian subsidiary of UK's Blue Circle Industries,
lifted operating profits for the year to November by 31 per cent, to
MDollars 80m (USDollars 30.1m) from MDollars 61m, writes Lim Sion Hoon in
Kuala Lumpur.
Turnover rose 26 per cent to MDollars 354m from MDollars 281m, thanks to the
high national level of infrastructure expenditures, which the group said was
likely to remain strong this year.
Attributable profit improved 31 per cent to MDollars 53m, or 24 cents per
share, for a 15 per cent return on shareholders' equity. The group
recommended a second-half dividend of 12 cents a share, bringing the year's
payout to 20 cents, down from 35 cents.
