Queen Elizabeth and Chancellor Helmut Kohl discuss Anglo-German ties before
lunch in Bonn yesterday. German government sources described the meeting
later as 'very friendly'.
The Queen was meeting Mr Kohl before heading into Germany's former communist
east for the rest of her trip, her first visit to this part of Europe.
