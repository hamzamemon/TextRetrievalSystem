NESTLE, the Swiss food group, has appointed Mr Serge Milhaud as chairman of
Source Perrier, the French mineral water company it acquired after the
European Commission agreed to its FFr15.46bn (Dollars 3.03bn) takeover bid,
writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. Mr Milhaud is already head of Nestle's
mineral water interests.
