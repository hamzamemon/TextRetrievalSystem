Moscow's city council has banned all demonstrations by all political parties
and groups on communism's most cherished anniversary, Revolution Day, on
November 7, Reuter reports. The ban was being introduced because some of the
groups which had applied to take part in Sunday's rally had been involved in
the abortive uprising against President Boris Yeltsin on October 3.
