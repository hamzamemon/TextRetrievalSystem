Cragnotti &amp; Partners Capital Investment, the fast-growing Italian financial
and industrial group, yesterday took control of Cirio Bertolli De Rica
(CBD), the Italian foods company, and prepared to bid for the rest of the
group.
The complex deal, if approved by IRI, the state holding company which owned
CBD, values the canned vegetable, edible oils and milk company at about
L500bn (Dollars 306m). However, Mr Cragnotti has pledged to retain CBD's
listing on the Milan stock exchange.
Yesterday's announcement should end a long period of speculation about CBD's
future, beginning last year when IRI first tried and failed to find a buyer
for the company, part of its large SME subsidiary, which is being
privatised.
IRI eventually sold control of CBD to Fisvi, a farm co-operative from
Apulia, which had to ask Cragnotti to help it with the acquisition through a
jointly-owned company.
Cragnotti yesterday bought out Fisvi's half of the joint venture, thus
raising its direct stake in CBD to 62 per cent.
