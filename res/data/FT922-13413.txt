A number of ornamental cherries of fairly complex parentage are simply known
by their garden names under the general heading Japanese Garden Cherries
since they were first introduced from Japan though many have since been
raised in the West. Pink Perfection is a particularly beautiful variety
raised in England from a seed taken from an old variety named Shimidsu. It
is considered by many gardeners to be better than the ever-popular Kanzan
since it is a purer pink colours. Like Kanzan its branches are held upwards
making a shuttlecock-shaped tree especially when young. The flowers are
fully double and freely produced. The young leaves are an attractive light
bronze. Like all Japanese cherries it will thrive in a wide variety of soils
with a special liking for those containing chalk or lime.
