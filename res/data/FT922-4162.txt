UN inspectors left Baghdad yesterday after disabling part of Iraq's nuclear
capability but fearing it still had potential to develop a nuclear bomb,
Reuter reports from Baghdad.
The 25-man team, led by Greek expert Mr Dimitri Perricos, had already
announced it was taking with it Iraq's last stocks of highly-enriched but
unradiated uranium.
