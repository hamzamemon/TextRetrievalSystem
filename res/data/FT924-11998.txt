Allied-Lyons has sold its 33.5 per cent holding in Coca-Cola Beverages
Nederland for an undisclosed cash sum to its two partners in the Dutch soft
drinks company, Coca-Cola and Interbrew, the Belgian brewer.
Mr Philip Butler, chairman of Allied Breweries Nederland, said: 'The sale is
part of our strategy of disposing of those businesses which do not fit with
our core activities.'
