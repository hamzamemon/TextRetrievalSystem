The French government has ordered another official enquiry into safety
standards at Superphenix, the world's largest super-generator, at
Creys-Malville in Isere, south-east France, writes Alice Rawsthorn. The
Superphenix, which took eight years to build at a cost of FFr26bn (Pounds
2.63bn), has been in full production for just six months in 16 years.
