India and Pakistan have agreed to high-level discussions on pulling back
troops from a disputed Himalayan glacier, Reuter reports from Islamabad.
Defence Ministry secretaries of the two countries will meet in late October
or early November to sort out differences on redeployment of troops,
Pakistani Foreign Ministry secretary Shaharyar Mohammad Khan told reporters.
Clashes have occurred as Pakistan repeatedly tried to retake the glacier in
an unmarked portion of a military control line dividing Kashmir into Indian
and Pakistani zones.
