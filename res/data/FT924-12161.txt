WORKERS at two Coventry Rolls-Royce plants making aircraft engine components
will today begin an overtime ban in protest at job losses.
Rolls-Royce informed employees at the plants last year that it needed to
shed about 500 jobs by the end of 1992. There have been insufficient
voluntary redundancies and Rolls-Royce said unions have declined
management's request for talks about the possibility of compulsory
redundancies.
