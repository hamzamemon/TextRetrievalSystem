Mr Carl Reichardt, the banker credited with converting Wells Fargo from one
of the most troubled US commercial banks in the late 1980s into one of the
most profitable, is stepping down as chairman and chief executive.
Mr Reichardt, who is 63, said he was retiring because the job of rebuilding
the bank's financial position was complete and he wanted to give other
managers a chance.
'There was just nothing to be gained from hanging around,' he said. 'People
hang around too long.'
