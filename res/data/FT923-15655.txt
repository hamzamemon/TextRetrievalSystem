THE public section of the privatisation of GIO Australia, the New South
Wales government's insurance company, has closed fully subscribed, with
applications exceeding ADollars 1bn (USDollars 0.70bn).
The NSW government yesterday claimed the float as Australia's biggest retail
capital raising, surpassing last year's offering of the federal
government-controlled Commonwealth Banking Corporation which raised about
ADollars 715m from non-institutional shareholders.
The GIO received more than 120,000 applications and plans to allocate 65 per
cent of the flotation to individual shareholders. The balance is being
offered to institutions under a tender system designed to determine a share
price between ADollars 2.10 and ADollars 2.40.
The strong public response suggests ADollars 2.40 a share is likely to be
achieved from institutional bidding. GIO shares are scheduled for listing in
early August.
