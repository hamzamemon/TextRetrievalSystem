FOUR WOMEN shopworkers who claimed that enforced Sunday closure of a West
Yorkshire branch of B&amp;Q, the DIY chain, amounted to unlawful sex
discrimination, yesterday lost the first round of their legal battle in the
High Court.
Mr Justice Ferris struck out an application for an injunction preventing
Kirklees Borough Council from enforcing the 1950 Shops Act at B&amp;Q's Dewsbury
store. The women and B&amp;Q, which was supporting their application, all said
they would appeal.
B&amp;Q said: 'The staff are willing and wanting to work. The only people who
will lose from this are the customers and the employees.' The judge said
their application - which was opposed by Sir Nicholas Lyell,
attorney-general, as well as Kirklees council - was 'doomed to failure',
having regard to 'the importance of enforcing what appeared to be the law of
the land'.
The women, who all face redundancy if the Dewsbury store is forced to close
on Sundays, were suing Kirklees for lost wages of between Pounds 182 and
Pounds 465 after the enforced closure of the store for 12 weeks in 1991.
They argued that the act amounted to unlawful sex discrimination because a
ban on Sunday working in the retail sector affected women more than men, as
most Sunday-only workers were women.
The judge said the material effect of the Shops Act was that no Sunday
retailing jobs should be made available except for the limited transactions
permitted by the act - not that such jobs might be made available subject to
a discriminatory condition.
Enforcement of the act meant simply that there would be no Sunday jobs for
either men or women.
B&amp;Q said it would not trade at Dewsbury on Sundays after May 31 after the
judge indicated he would grant Kirklees a temporary injunction against
Sunday opening pending the dispute's resolution.
