Sir, The plan by Michael Howard, the home secretary, to introduce a law to
punish those who obtain private information by deception is long overdue
('Howard moves to protect confidential information', April 16).
As legislation throughout Europe moves towards greater transparency when
storing personal information on computer, the growth of an underworld
dealing in 'confidential information' is an insidious corollary.
A deterrent is vital, and criminalisation is a welcome development.
