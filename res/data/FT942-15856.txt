ckleys, the Telford-based pavior and brick maker, lifted 1993 pre-tax
profits by 19 per cent, from Pounds 352,000 to Pounds 419,000.
Although operating profits were lower at Pounds 1.27m (Pounds 1.6m), the
pre-tax result was helped by a Pounds 46,000 surplus on the sale of property
and reduced interest and similar charges of Pounds 899,000 (Pounds 1.24m).
Turnover fell slightly to Pounds 9.22m (Pounds 9.3m) although for the first
time in four years there was in increase in sales volume.
Earnings per share rose to 1.04p (0.73p) and a maintained final dividend of
0.5p is proposed for an unchanged 1p total.
