Sir, On Saturday I read with alarm Mr Major's wish to reduce inflation to
zero in the next parliament, assuming the Conservatives are returned with a
majority.
As a life-long Conservative who is not enjoying Mr Major's 'if it ain't
hurting, it's not working' routine, I view with horror the effect this cold
water treatment will have on us loyal followers and will not now vote
Conservative.
