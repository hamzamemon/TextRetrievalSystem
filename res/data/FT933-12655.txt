British Aerospace is pulling out of Romania and suspending a licensing
agreement under which the country manufactures BAC 1-11 airlinersbecause of
lack of payment by its local partner, Virginia Marsh reports from Bucharest.
Romaero, the state owned aircraft manufacturer, said yesterday it had
accrued a Dollars 10m debt to BAe since 1987.
The move places in doubt a Dollars 250m contract which Romaero concluded
last February to build 11 up-graded BAC 1-11s for Kiwi International, a new
US airline.
