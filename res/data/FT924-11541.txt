FORMER BCCI staff intend to sue the Bank of England for negligence, Mr
Quasir Malik, a former BBCI manager co- ordinating staff claims for
compensation, said last night. He said about 70 ex-employees had instructed
solicitors to begin proceedings for compensation on the grounds that the
Bank failed to regulate BCCI properly.
