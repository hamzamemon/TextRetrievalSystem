Camas, the building materials group demerged from English China Clays in
June, is paying Dollars 15.1m (Pounds 9.5m) for the majority assets of C&amp;M
Ready Mix Concrete of Boulder, Colorado.
The assets comprise about 12m tons of proven aggregate reserves, which are
situated north-east of Denver, five ready mixed plants and a fleet of
concrete delivery trucks. In addition, Camas will receive Dollars 3m of
income from trade contracts already undertaken.
Mr Christopher Bailey, Camas finance director, said the deal would probably
push the group into first position in the Denver ready mix market ahead of
Redland.
C&amp;M reported operating profits of Dollars 1.5m in 1993.
