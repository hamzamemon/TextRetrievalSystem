MR NEIL CLARKE, British Coal's chairman, told mining unions yesterday that
improved productivity and cost control meant the company could be confident
about its future. NUM leader Mr Arthur Scargill was less optimistic. He said
up to 30,000 jobs and 35 pits were at risk if contracts to supply
electricity generators were not agreed.
