The privatisation of British Rail promises to spawn a whole new generation
of excuses.
A colleague reports that, when the 19.50 Waterloo to Portsmouth Harbour
train left a few minutes late the other night, the 'senior conductor'
explained to passengers - now travelling courtesy of South West Trains  -
that the delay was due to the signalman (now employed by Railtrack) having
made a mistake and let the 19.53 Bournemouth train out first.
