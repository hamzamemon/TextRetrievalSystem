One ethnic Albanian was killed and two Serbian soldiers were wounded
yesterday outside the Yugoslav army headquarters in Pristina, capital of the
mainly Albanian province of Kosovo, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. An
eyewitness said the shootings occurred after three men approached a guard,
stabbed him and shot another soldier in the stomach. Other soldiers returned
fire, killing a 26-year-old ethnic Albanian. The other two assailants, one
of them wounded, escaped.
A conflicting statement from the Democratic League of Kosovo, the main
Albanian party, said the sentries had provoked the three passers-by. Mr
Saqir Saqiri, a leader of the DLK, said: 'We are used to such daily
provocations, Serbia wants provocations.' The incident comes amid growing
concern that Kosovo could be the next region of former Yugoslavia to erupt
in ethnic war.
