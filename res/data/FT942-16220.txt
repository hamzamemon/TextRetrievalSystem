Ryanair, the Dublin-based independent airline, is to expand its budget
'no-frills' UK-Ireland services with two new UK destinations out of Dublin
from next month, Tim Coone writes from Dublin.
Adding Manchester and Glasgow to its destinations of Stansted, Luton,
Liverpool and Birmingham, Ryanair aims to capture market share from Aer
Lingus, the state-run airline, and Irish Sea ferry operators.
Ryanair will operate eight flights a day to Manchester and four to Glasgow.
