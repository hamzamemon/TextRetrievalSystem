PROSPECTS for Lloyd's of London are improving, but opportunities for
investors will remain limited, a report published this week by Salomon
Brothers concludes, Richard Lapper writes.
The report, The London Insurance Market - a Leaner, More Focused Lloyd's,
which is available to clients of the US securities house, says there are
signs that many insurance companies and syndicates are withdrawing from the
market following a run of heavy losses since 1987, but the market is still
troubled by overcapacity. Profitability levels will thus stay depressed.
It says underwriters will continue to struggle for returns 'that compare
favourably on a risk-adjusted basis with more traditional investment
opportunities.'
