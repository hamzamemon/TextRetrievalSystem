SALMOND Smith Biolab yesterday launched a shares and cash NZDollars 28m
(USDollars 15.4m) takeover bid for rival New Zealand fish farmer, Regal
Salmon.
The bid follows a fall in the Regal Salmon share price following a turnround
in earnings from a NZDollars 2m profit last year to a NZDollars 3.3m loss in
the year ended March.
Regal Salmon shares have fallen from a high of NZDollars 2.60 late last year
to around 80 cents prior to the bid.
