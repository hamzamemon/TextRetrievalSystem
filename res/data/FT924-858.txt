The French government yesterday agreed to help bail out the Unedic
unemployment pay system, run jointly by employers and unions, from its
impending bankruptcy, writes David Buchan in Paris.
After employers and unions accused the state of shirking its
responsibilities, the government agreed to shoulder more of the cost of
early retirements and of dole for people coming off temporary state-run
employment schemes, and to subsidise the interest rate on Unedic's
borrowings.
