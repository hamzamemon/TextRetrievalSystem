Zetters Group reported a 21 per cent expansion in pre-tax profits for the
six months to September 30 1991.
The increase - from Pounds 372,111 to Pounds 451,010 - was achieved in spite
of a fall in turnover from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 11m.
Earnings per share were at 4.1p (3.4p), and, in a move to reduce disparity,
the interim dividend is lifted to 4p (1.75p).
