A Venezuelan criminal court judge issued warrants at the weekend for the
arrest of 19 people, including executives of GTE and AT&amp;T in Venezuela, as
part of an investigation into a gas pipeline explosion outside Caracas that
killed about 50 people, writes Joseph Mann in Caracas.
The explosion on September 28 occurred allegedly when an excavating machine
digging a trench for fibre-optic cable struck an underground natural gas
pipeline. CANTV, the privatised telecommunications company run by a
consortium headed by GTE of the US, contracted AT&amp;T Andinos to lay the
fibre-optic cable.
AT&amp;T sub-contracted a Venezuelan company, Abengoa, to carry out the work.
The pipeline is operated by Corpoven, a subsidiary of the national oil
company PDVSA. No one has accepted responsibility.
