THE United Mine Workers of America intensified their three-week-old strike
against US coal producers last night by extending the stoppage to
Pennsylvania and West Virginia mines owned by Consol Energy, Inc., Rochester
and Pittsburgh Coal Company, and CLI Corp.
Consol, jointly owned by the German conglomerate Rheinbraun AG and the US
chemical company, DuPont, is the second-largest US coal producer. Consol's
president, Mr. Bobby Brown, is the lead negotiator for the Bituminous Coal
Operator's Association's contract talks with the union.
The union is seeking guarantees from BCOA companies that new mines will hire
union workers.
