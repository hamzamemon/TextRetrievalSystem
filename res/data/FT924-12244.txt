Military authorities have approved special committees to take over the
running of political parties blamed for messing up Nigeria's transition to
civil rule, Reuter reports from Lagos. Elections commission chairman
Humphrey Nwosu yesterday said President Ibrahim Babangida had endorsed
caretaker committees to lead the welfare-minded Social Democratic party
(SDP) and the rightist National Republican Convention (NRC).
