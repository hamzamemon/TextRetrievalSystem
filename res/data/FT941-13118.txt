Almost three-fifths of students in further education were female in 1991-92,
compared with two-fifths 20 years ago.
The number of secondary-school pupils dropped by a quarter between 1980-81
and 1990-91. Yet more are staying on beyond the official leaving age, and
the proportion leaving without GCSE or equivalent qualifications halved in
the 15 years to 1990-91.
