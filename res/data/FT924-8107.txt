PARTNERSHIPS WILL be able to take advantage of the company voluntary
arrangements and administration procedures available under UK insolvency
law, under draft legislation issued by the government's insolvency service
yesterday.
The proposed insolvency partnership order would allow greater opportunities
to assist or rescue partnerships - such as accountancy and law firms - which
run into difficulty.
It follows lobbying to the service, part of the Department of Trade and
Industry, by the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency.
Voluntary arrangements and administration orders were introduced by the 1986
Insolvency Act to provide simpler or cheaper alternatives to formal court
winding-up orders for companies.
