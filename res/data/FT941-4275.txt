James Hardie, the Australian building materials group, is to float its
Hardie Technologies subsidiary, which manufactures printed circuit board
assemblies and distributes electronic components, writes Nikki Tait in
Sydney. The Melbourne-based company is expected to have revenues of around
Adollars 70m (USdollars 33m) in the year to end-March. Flotation details are
being finalised, but Hardie said that the disposal was part of its strategy
of shedding non-core investments.
