Armed supporters of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement drive through the
Bophuthatswana capital of Mmabatho yesterday. The South African army later
moved into the black 'homeland', chasing out rightwing whites and attempting
to restore order after riots left dozens of people dead. The events were
seen as a humiliating defeat for the right wing. Report, Page 22
