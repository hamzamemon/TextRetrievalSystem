Mr Chris Patten, governor of Hong Kong, is likely to introduce the more
controversial elements of his democracy reform proposals to the Legislative

non-controversial elements, which include lowering the voting age to 18 from
21, and says it will dismantle all elected bodies upon regaining
sovereignty.
