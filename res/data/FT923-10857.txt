THE disciplinary hearing against two partners of accountants Coopers &amp;
Lybrand accused of an alleged breach of professional ethical rules over
their appointment as administrators to Polly Peck International opened in
London yesterday.
Mr Richard Stone, head of corporate finance, and Mr Michael Jordan, head of
Cork Gully, Coopers' insolvency arm, appeared before a panel of the
professional conduct committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales in a hearing which is expected to last five days.
The two men face charges that they breached the institute's ethical
guidelines by accepting the appointment in October 1990 when there had been
'a continuing professional relationship' between Coopers, Polly Peck and Mr
Asil Nadir, its chairman, during the previous three years.
