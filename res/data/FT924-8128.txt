A clash between Moscow and the breakaway southern Russian republic of
Chechnya was averted yesterday when Russian troops withdrew from a disputed
area on Chechnya's borders, writes Our Foreign Staff.
The troops, sent into neighbouring Ingushetia to quell a fierce outbreak of
ethnic violence, had occupied three regions claimed by the Chechen republic,
which declared independence from Russia last year.
They were withdrawn following all-night negotiations between the two sides
and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting Russian prime minister.
More than 200 people have died in fighting between Ingush and Ossetians from
the neighbouring Russian republic of North Ossetia over the past week,
according to Russian television.
