However, it is not all doom and gloom. A fellow diner at London's Ritz Hotel
restaurant yesterday reports that the number of tables graced by the
presence of Scottish Life company actuaries was 18.18 per cent recurring,
which sounds better than two tables out of eleven. Admittedly, it was a bit
of a slow day at the Ritz, but if Scotland's actuaries can justify a table
at the Ritz, then perhaps the good times can't be quite so far away.
