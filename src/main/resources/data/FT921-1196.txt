Guerrillas with automatic rifles fired on a bus in Istanbul yesterday,
killing two Turkish intelligence officers and wounding seven others, Reuter
reports from Istanbul. The Dev-Sol (Revolutionary Left) group claimed to
have carried out the attack. The group has joined forces with the separatist
Kurdish Workers party (PKK), which has vowed to spread its rebellion to big
cities. At least 55 people have been killed in south-east Turkey since
Saturday in clashes between government forces and PKK rebels.
