Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, has confirmed there will be a M4
motorway relief road south of Newport, but has decided to have further
public consultation on the route.
Nearly 6,000 responses have been made since the Welsh Office last year
proposed a choice of one of three routes, each of about 22km and costing
about Pounds 300m.
