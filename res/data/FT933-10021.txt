AN EXTRA 100,000 jobs would be made available to disabled people if
public-sector employers observed quotas, the Trades Union Congress has told
the government.
Larger employers are supposed to offer 3 per cent of jobs to registered
disabled people. Government departments, apart from the National Health
Service, are exempt but say they aim to meet the quota voluntarily.
The TUC says the government's figures show that the Department of Employment
is the only one to do this, while only 17 local councils meet the quota. No
figures are collected on private-sector employers, but the TUC fears they
'may have an even worse record'.
