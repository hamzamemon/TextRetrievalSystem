NEXT YEAR'S world environment summit will be in Manchester in September to
tackle implementation of plans agreed at this year's summit in Rio de
Janeiro.
Britain offered to host the summit after Mr John Major's visit to Rio and
Manchester defeated bids from London, Edinburgh, Brighton, Reading and
Norwich.
