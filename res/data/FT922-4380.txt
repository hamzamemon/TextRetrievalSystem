THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry launched an initiative yesterday to
encourage students to study for higher science degrees through industrial
partnerships, Daniel Green writes.
The department has allocated Pounds 2m a year to the five schemes. They will
take on 100 students by the start of the 1993-94 academic year.
The partnerships are a pilot for Faraday Centres, promised by ministers
before the general election and recommended in last month's final report of
the Prince of Wales's Working Group on Innovation. The scheme, managed by
the DTI and the Science and Engineering Research Council, will lead to
conventional MScs and PhDs in a wide range of industrial disciplines.
