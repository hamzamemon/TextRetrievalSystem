AT&amp;T's Picasso still-image phone, above, allows users to send full-colour,
TV-quality still pictures, using an ordinary phone line - while
simultaneously talking over the same line. The system, priced at Dollars
3,295, takes about ten seconds to transmit a single image. The intended
market is for engineers and other professionals needing fast transmission of
detailed images.
The device looks like an office phone, but contains a data modem and
transceiver. To transmit a picture, users plug in a video camera, photo
compact disk player or digital still cameras. On the receiving end, a
computer monitor or TV set displays the picture.
