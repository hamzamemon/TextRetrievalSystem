PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the Cincinnati-based consumer products group, has reached
an agreement which will lead to the manufacture of P&amp;G detergent products in
Russia.
The announcement comes as some big US consumer product companies are
delaying expansion plans in the former Soviet Union because of the turbulent
situation there and lack of infrastructure. P&amp;G stressed that the detergent
deal does not have significant financial implications.
The agreement has been signed with PO Novomoskovskbytkhim, a state-owned
industrial complex at Novomoskovsk, about 130 miles south of Moscow. The
agreement provides for P&amp;G to supply detergent formulations and technical
assistance.
P&amp;G, whose detergent brands include Ariel, Mr Proper and Dash, has been
selling products in St Petersburg for about a year through a joint venture
with the university there. The products, however, are made in Europe and
imported. Under the new agreement, the products will be made at the
Novomoskovsk plant.
