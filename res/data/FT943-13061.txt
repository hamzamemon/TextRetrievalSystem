British Coal yesterday completed its programme of offering closed collieries
to the private sector when it agreed terms with Coal Investments, the mining
company, for the resumption of operations at Silverdale colliery in
Staffordshire.
Of the 28 closed pits made available in the last 16 months, leases and
licences have been granted for nine. The other 19 have been closed.
