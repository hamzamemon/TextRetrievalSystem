Mohamed Boudiaf, Algeria's new head of state, returned to Algiers yesterday
to a hero's welcome after 28 years' exile in Morocco. Boudiaf, 72, a veteran
of Algeria's independence war, warned Islamic fundamentalists not to use
religion to pursue their own interests. He will head the five-man High
Council of State set up following the resignation of President Chadli
Bendjedid on Saturday. Story, Page 4
