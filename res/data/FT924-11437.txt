ASAHI Breweries, the Japanese beer company, has reduced its stake in
Foster's Brewing Group, the Australian brewer, by selling the bulk of its
entitlement to a new share issue.
Asahi has sold 88m shares, reducing its stake in Foster's, the world's
fourth-largest beer maker, from 20 per cent to 17 per cent.
Foster's is raising some ADollars 1bn (USDollars 700m) by issuing two new
shares for every five held.
Asahi obtained a 20 per cent stake in the Australian brewer in 1990. It had
expressed interest in increasing its stake, but had decided to sell its
rights.
The company faces a cash-flow squeeze due to increases in interest payments
on bank borrowings and straight bonds.
