The Confederation of British Industry yesterday said 500 companies could be
saved each year if insolvency laws were revised, Jenny Luesby writes.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, backed the government's aim of
introducing a more flexible insolvency procedure, saying 'every possible
step' should be taken to keep good companies afloat.
'The economy cannot afford to lose firms which a more sympathetic approach
would save,' he said.
The DTI has suggested that companies should be able to declare a moratorium
for 28 days while they tried to arrange creditor terms for at least 75 per
cent of their debts.
The CBI backed the idea of a moratorium, but suggested that companies should
be able to extend the initial 28 days to a period of up to six months,
rather than the maximum three months proposed by the DTI.
