Sir, The initiative of Clive Lewis, president of the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors, in establishing a review of valuation procedures is
laudable (Letters, November 10).
The Queens Moat valuation controversy is, however, current and should not
await the outcome of Michael Mallinson's review. I would urge Clive Lewis to
ensure that the assets valuation standards committee fully reviews both
Queens Moat valuations and that its report carries a clear explanation of
the differences and is made public.
If this does not occur then the surveying profession will lose credibility
in the business environment where it is striving to obtain better
recognition.
