UNION recognition at workplaces set up in the 1980s was much lower than in
previous decades, a study suggests.
The research into the reasons behind employers' recognition of unions
concludes that it is a 'long-term decision made at or near the set-up date
of an establishment'. It argues that product and labour-market structure at
that date play an important role in determining union recognition.
The study suggests that factors such as industry-wide union density,
technology, and expected workforce composition are crucial to recognition.
