MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, has urged Western Isles council to
consider a substantial increase in its poll tax in order to maintain
services after losing Pounds 23m in the collapse of Bank of Credit and
Commerce International.
The islands' poll tax this year is only Pounds 26, after the government's
Pounds 140 cut. Mr Major suggests the council should bring it closer to the
Scottish average of Pounds 282.
