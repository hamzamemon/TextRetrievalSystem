Clydeport Holdings, operator of port facilities on the Clyde, returned
after-tax profits of Pounds 2.4m for the year to end-December.
Despite recessionary conditions and the loss of the Ravensgraig and
Hunterson traffic, turnover held up well at Pounds 11.8m.
Mr John Mather, chairman and chief executive, said the 'excellent start'
achieved by the company in its first year of operation had continued
throughout 1993.
