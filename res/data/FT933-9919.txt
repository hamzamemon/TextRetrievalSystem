THE US Resolution Trust Corp said Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, had
agreed to pay Dollars 82m to settle charges that negligent audits
contributed to the collapse of several savings and loans, Reuter reports
from Washington.
Arthur Andersen said the agreement was largely covered by insurance and that
it would not have a material financial impact.
