The British government was under strong pressure last night to extradite US
pilots involved in the deaths of nine British servicemen during the Gulf
war. A UK inquest ruled they had been 'unlawfully killed' in an incident
involving so-called 'friendly fire'.
The jury's surprise decision may force government law officers into a choice
between souring relations with the US or facing a backlash from the victims'
families and MPs.
