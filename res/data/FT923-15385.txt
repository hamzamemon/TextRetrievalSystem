DELEGATES at the National Union of Mineworkers' annual conference yesterday
voted unanimously to strike if necessary in opposition to the privatisation
of British Coal, Diane Summers writes. The move came in spite of warnings
from some delegates that miners in their areas would not be prepared to
strike over the issue.
Mr Peter Heathfield, NUM general secretary, hit back at delegates for
declaring they would not take industrial action and said it would undermine
the campaign.
