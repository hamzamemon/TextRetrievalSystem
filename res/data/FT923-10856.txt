CIVIL SERVICE unions have put to ballot an offer for top civil servants
which includes a 3.9 per cent pay increase coupled with a radical extension
of performance-related pay.
It is understood that the FDA and IPMS are likely to recommend acceptance of
the offer while the executive of the NUCPS meets today to decide whether it
will do the same.
