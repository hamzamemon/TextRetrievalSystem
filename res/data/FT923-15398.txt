Congo's interim prime minister, Mr Andre Milongo, was the big loser in the
country's first multi-party elections for 30 years, Reuter reports from
Brazzaville. Official results published early yesterday showed that no
candidate from 30 parties supporting Mr Milongo was elected in the first
round of voting on June 24.
