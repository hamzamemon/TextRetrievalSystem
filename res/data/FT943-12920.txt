Black &amp; Decker is to create 180 permanent jobs at its plant at Spennymoor,
County Durham, as a result of a restructuring of its European power tools
manufacturing and the launch of new products.
It is also to offer 120 Spennymoor employees on nine-month-a-year contracts
permanent, full-year jobs.
Under the restructuring, announced early this year, the company is shutting
its plant at Limburg, near Frankfurt, which employs 480 people, and
consolidating production of virtually all its consumer power tools for the
European market at Spennymoor.
