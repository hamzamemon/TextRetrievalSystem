A CANDY-STRIPED book landed on the desks of Japanese building executives
yesterday, instructing them in the fine arts of competition and the dangers
of dango, Robert Thomson reports from Tokyo.
Dango are cosy cartels to 'smooth out the bumps of competition' - as an
executive once put it - by awarding contracts, fixing prices and generally
rigging bids. They have upset the US, which wants to prise open the market
for its contractors. By publishing the book, Japan's Federation of
Construction Contractors hopes to show the US it is tackling the problem.
Publication coincides with a warning by the Construction Ministry to 66
companies found to have rigged bids for government projects in Tokyo.
