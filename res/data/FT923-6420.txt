The South African government is to hold exploratory talks with the ANC and
the Pan-Africanist Congress during the next 48 hours, Reuter reports from
Johannesburg. Government spokesman Izak Retief said Mr Roelf Meyer, the
chief government negotiator, was due to meet a PAC delegation yesterday and
would probably resume direct talks with ANC secretary-general Cyril
Ramaphosa today.
