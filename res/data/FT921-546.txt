The offer for the M &amp; G Recovery Investment Trust has now closed, with
widespread expectations that it will not have raised as much as the Pounds
246m the group raised for its Income Trust last year. The share price of
that trust, which was largely bought by investors for its high yield, has
drifted down to around 92p since issue from the 100p offer price. Both
issues have split capital structures.
