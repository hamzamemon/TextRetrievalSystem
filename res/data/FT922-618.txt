MR POUL Schluter, Denmark's prime minister, will tell his 11 partners at the
Lisbon summit that his parliament's powerful market affairs committee has
ruled out a new referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, writes Hilary Barnes in
Copenhagen.
The electorate rejected the treaty in a June 2 referendum. Mr Bjorn Westh,
from the opposition Social Democratic Party, said the referendum result was
binding and could not simply be reversed.
The consequences of the referendum rebuff are not on the agenda in Lisbon,
but Mr Schluter said he expects to discuss the matter.
