Ukraine's parliament yesterday partially endorsed the state budget for 1992,
after rejecting three earlier versions, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev.
The budget, which sets total expenditure at Rbs1,179bn with a deficit of 2
per cent of gross domestic product, was attacked by reformers for failing to
initiate structural economic changes and by hardliners for capping social
subsidies. After two days of fierce debate, deputies endorsed the budget in
principle and ordered the government to present a final draft by June 15.
