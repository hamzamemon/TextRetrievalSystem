Munich's mayor yesterday banned a pro-Kurdish demonstration planned for
today. The ban follows a rally last month in Germany which ended in battles
between police and Kuirds and protesters' self-immolation. Mayor Christian
Ude said city authorities had 'reliable information' that Kurdish militants
seeking an independent homeland in Turkey planned to use the rally to stage
acts of violence. The charges of violence were denied by Kurdish and German
organisers.
