Sir, I refer to Michael Dixon's article in which he gives details of various
new 'guerrilla tactics' to get beyond the secretary (Jobs: 'How to get round
the secretarial barrier', June 3).
I am a 'gate-keeper' about whom he writes. I can inform him that his novel
ideas were around at the invention of typewriter ribbons and died long
before the advent of electronic mail.
