Plantsbrook, the funeral services group, has conditionally agreed to buy
Portland Funeral Services, of Kilmarnock, for Pounds 790,000 cash.
It is also at an advanced stage of negotiation for another similar sized
acquisition, and is raising Pounds 2m through the placing of 3.38m shares at
60p each.
Portland carries out some 560 funerals per annum and is expected to enhance
earnings in the first year of ownership.
