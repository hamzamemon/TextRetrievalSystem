The European Commission yesterday unveiled a job-creation strategy which it
hopes will help halve unemployment in the EC by the end of the century,
writes Andrew Hill.
The EC-wide 'framework for employment', agreed by the Commission at its
meeting in Strasbourg, aims to improve the Community's comparatively poor
record on employment.
The Commission proposes that member states should co-ordinate action, for
example by encouraging employees to adapt to different types of job,
developing new practices - such as job-sharing - and 'investigating the
scope for reducing labour costs'.
