The delay in opening up the Pounds 3.3bn milk market in England and Wales to
competition will be investigated next week by the Commons agriculture select
committee, Deborah Hargreaves writes.
The committee said it would hold a special session to examine why market
liberalisation had been put back from April to November. Government
objections to the Milk Marketing Board's plans to turn itself into a
voluntary farmers' co-operative have delayed introduction of competition.
