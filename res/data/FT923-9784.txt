Fourteen people were killed and 97 wounded in Kabul yesterday when dissident
guerrillas rained rockets and mortar bombs on the Afghan capital, government
officials said, Reuter reports from Kabul.
Defence Minister Ahmad Shah Masood said the attack was carried out by the
two factions of the hardline Hezb-i-Islami party. The official Kabul Radio
said a ceasefire was arranged in the afternoon, after one of the most
devastating bombardments of the city since mujahideen guerrillas took power
in April.
