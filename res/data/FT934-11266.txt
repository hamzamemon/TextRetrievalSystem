THE GOVERNMENT yesterday issued invitations to 'pre-qualify' to potential
purchasers of Belfast International Airport. Applications must be submitted
by December 1 to Touche Ross, the accountancy firm acting for the
government.
In its last full year, the airport had a turnover of Pounds 23m with
after-tax profits of Pounds 2.5m.
