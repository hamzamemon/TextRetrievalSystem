THE HARD Ecu represents the only option left for business to gain full
advantage from the single European market, the Institute of Directors said
yesterday. It said that, with the timetable for a single currency
'inevitably delayed', the early introduction of a common currency was of
paramount importance for the European economy.
Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, said the present method envisaged for
creating monetary union was unrealistic and that the hard Ecu 'currently
represents the best alternative route'.
