Argentina's inflation rate fell to zero in August, its lowest level in 25
years, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires. Inflation so far this year has
fallen to 5.8 per cent - almost a third less than in the first eight months
of last year - and official forecasts put next year's inflation rate at 4-5
per cent.
