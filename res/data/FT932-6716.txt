A LORD who followed a tradition of not speaking until he had something to
say made his maiden speech to the House of Lords yesterday - 43 years after
he took up his seat.
'I am pleased to make my somewhat overdue maiden speech in a debate which
affects my locality considerably,' said 64-year-old Lord Trevor, who entered
the Lords in 1950, and who lives near Wrexham, north Wales.
His lordship, the fourth baron in his Welsh lineage, broke his silence in a
debate on proposals for new committees to oversee the police.
