Turnover at Air London International, the charter broker, rose from Pounds
15.2m to Pounds 18.1m for the year to July 31.
However, pressure on margins and higher overheads, arising mainly from
increased sales efforts, left pre-tax profits 13 per cent lower at Pounds
640,000, against Pounds 726,000.
Earnings per share dropped to 4.7p (5.6p) but an unchanged recommended final
dividend of 1.9p holds the total at 3.5p.
