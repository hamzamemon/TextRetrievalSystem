Western countries pledged Dollars 830m (Pounds 467m) in aid to Uganda
yesterday and urged it to improve its human rights record, saying this would
affect future aid levels, Reuter reports from Paris. The money, promised
after a two-day meeting chaired by the World Bank, would be split into
Dollars 500m for projects and Dollars 330m for balance of payments
assistance.
