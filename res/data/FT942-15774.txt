Alec Stewart (right) and Mike Atherton celebrate England's victory in the
fourth cricket Test yesterday, when they became the first team to beat the
West Indies in Barbados for 59 years. They bowled out the home side for 237
to secure a 208-run victory. Stewart was named man of the match for his two
centuries. The West Indies have already won the five-match series, having
taken the first three Tests.
