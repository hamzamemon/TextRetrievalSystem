PROF Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, yesterday rejected
accusations that he had been slow to react to the mounting coal crisis,
David Lascelles writes.
Prof Littlechild is studying electricity companies' purchasing decisions to
see whether they have been unfairly favouring gas over coal. Critics say he
should have had such a review long ago.
Prof Littlechild said an earlier review 'would have found lower gas prices
than now and higher prices offered for electricity from coal-fired plant'.
He said that on other counts 'it simply cannot be assumed that an earlier
review would have avoided pit closures and, in any case, the government has
declared a moratorium'.
