A company based in Farnham, Surrey, has launched what it claims is the
world's smallest PC based on a 486 chip - a machine no bigger than a VHS
cassette.
Lynwood believes its mini-machine, the MC40, will be used by systems
integrators to build the power of the 486 chip into systems where
traditional PCs have been too bulky - in the boot of a car for mobile
computing, for example. In an office a series of the boxes could be rack
mounted to save space. Lynwood: UK, 0252 734488.
