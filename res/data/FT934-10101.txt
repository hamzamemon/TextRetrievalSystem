MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday said that his party's next
general election manifesto may include pledges about a maximum working week
of 35 hours or four days.
He was speaking in Brussels, where today he will sign a European socialist
manifesto which includes heavy cuts in working time to end the recession and
cut unemployment.
'I am sure workers in Britain will back measures for economic development,
full employment and social progress,' he said. A 35-hour week was 'one
possibility'.
'The Conservative way is to accept high unemployment as an almost permanent
feature of our society,' he said. 'We are challenging that in the European
elections.'
