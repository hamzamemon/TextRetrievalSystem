MORGAN Guaranty Trust, the leading US bank, is shifting its market making in
Swiss franc foreign exchange and forward rate agreements (FRA) from Zurich
to London.
The move is another blow to Zurich's status as a financial centre. Morgan is
by far the most active foreign bank in these markets in the Swiss financial
capital, exceeded only by the big three Swiss banks.
'The trend to London will be underlined by our move,' Mr Karl Preisig,
managing director of Morgan's Zurich branch, admitted.
Mr Preisig said the decision was prompted by the need to save money and by
the declining level of activity in Zurich. Most foreign banks have already
given up interbank trading there and even the big Swiss banks have shifted a
large part of their trading to London, he said.
The shift will affect seven of Morgan's 150 staff in Zurich. Six are moving
to London and the other is being reassigned within the bank. Mr Preisig said
Morgan would continue to make markets in Zurich in local products and was
strengthening its contacts with Swiss customers.
