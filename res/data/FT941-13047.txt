'So, do you think you're getting the hang of this derivatives business,
Simpkin?' the bailiffs enquire with ill-concealed glee as they bundle the
contents of Simpkin's office into their van.
Roger Beale's cartoon in Wednesday's FT, illustrating an article on those
damnably tricky financial instruments called derivatives, did not escape the
notice of one Guy Simpkin, head of quantitative research at BZW Asset
Management.
Luckily he seems to have a sense of humour.
