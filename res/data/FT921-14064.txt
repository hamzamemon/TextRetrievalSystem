A LISTED Regency villa in Regent's Park, London, has been put up for sale
for Pounds 17.5m following the death of Mr Robert Holmes a Court, the
Australian financier, 18 months ago, Vanessa Houlder writes.
The 12,300 sq ft Grade 1 listed building, built in 1824 by Decimus Burton,
has four acres of private parkland. Mr Holmes a Court bought the villa in
1986 for Pounds 8m, spent two years renovating it and used it as a base for
his international investment operations.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, the agents, said Mrs Janet Holmes a Court is selling
the building because she spends less time in London than did her husband.
