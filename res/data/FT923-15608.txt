The New Zealand Reserve Bank, the country's central bank, yesterday warned
the government that any structural deterioration in the financial deficit in
tomorrow's budget could force it to tighten monetary policy, writes Terry
Hall in Wellington.
The bank said in yesterday's six-monthly statement that it expected actual
inflation would rise from 0.8 per cent in the year ended March 1992 to 1.8
per cent by the end of the current year.
