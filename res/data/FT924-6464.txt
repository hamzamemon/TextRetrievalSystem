Norway's parliament voted yesterday to apply to join the EC even though
opinion polls show most voters oppose membership, Reuter reports from Oslo.
Parliament voted 104 to 55 in favour of applying in a victory for Labour
premier Gro Harlem Brundtland.
Mrs Brundtland plans to travel to London on November 25, to hand an
application to British Prime Minister John Major.
