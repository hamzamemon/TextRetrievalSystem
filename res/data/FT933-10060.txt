Zimbabwe's government will not back down on plans to force white farmers to
sell their land, Mr Kumbirai Kangai, the agriculture minister, said at the
annual congress of the Commercial Farmers' Union which ended yesterday,
Reuter reports from Harare.
There would be social strife without land reform, the minister said. 'Land
just has to be redistributed because if it is not, then those with no land
will take the law into their own hands and there will be social trouble,'
said the minister.
CFU delegates said the government had a 'racial agenda' in its land
redistribution programme.
