Two out of three secretaries say they would rather be doing another job and
many believe their skills and qualifications are being wasted by companies
which ignore their potential, a report says today.
Type Cast, the report of a survey of 540 secretaries and 396 managers
published today by the Industrial Society, concludes that work
dissatisfaction among secretaries is rife.
The society described secretaries and administrative staff as 'the most
undervalued, under-utilised and under-developed section of the 90s
workforce'. Nearly half the secretaries questioned said they wanted
management careers.
