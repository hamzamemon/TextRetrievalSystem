Sweden's main opposition Social Democrats yesterday demanded a new
broad-based government of national unity, to deal with the country's
problems, Robert Thomson writes from Stockholm.
Mr Ingvar Carisson, party leader, called on the small Centre Party and the
Liberals to break from the coalition and join the Social Democrats in a new
administration.
