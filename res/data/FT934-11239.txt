To mark National Library Week, the British Library's reading room at the
British Museum was opened to the public yesterday for the first time since
it was built in 1857. The 10m books in the library, founded in 1753, will
soon be moved to the new British Library building on Euston Road in north
London, and the vacated room will be used for British Museum exhibits
