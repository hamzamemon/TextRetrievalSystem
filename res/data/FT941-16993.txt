Russian monthly inflation slowed to 12 per cent in December, the lowest
level for the whole of last year after strenuous efforts by the finance
ministry to cut spending wherever it could and restrain the country's habit
of printing money to finance the budget deficit, writes Leyla Boulton.
This brought annual inflation to about 900 per cent in 1993 from 2,500 per
cent in 1992. The monthly rate for December compared to 15 per cent in
November and 20 per cent in October.
