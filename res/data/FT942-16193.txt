British Coal Enterprise and Qualitec, the training and enterprise council
for St Helens, Lancashire, have each put Pounds 100,000 into a revolving
fund for unsecured loans to small businesses.
The fund will lend up to Pounds 25,000, or half the costs of a project -
whichever is lower - over three to five years at a fixed 9 per cent interest
rate.
