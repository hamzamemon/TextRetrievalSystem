MR Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, has appointed Samuel Montagu, the
merchant bank, to act as the government's financial adviser on the Channel
tunnel rail link.
Samuel Montagu's main task will be to explore ways of involving the private
sector in the project and, if possible, handing it over to the private
sector altogether.
