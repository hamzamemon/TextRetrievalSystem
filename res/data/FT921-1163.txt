LABOUR and the Conservatives are collaborating in a 'tax is bad' campaign
which will hinder future social provision by the government, Mr Des Wilson,
the Liberal Democrats' campaign director, complained last night.
Liberal Democrats backed a one penny increase in the basic rate of income
tax to fund Pounds 2bn extra spending on education because 'it's the best
investment we can make', he said in a speech in Aylesbury.
