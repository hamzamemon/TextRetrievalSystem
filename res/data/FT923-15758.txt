Consumers will have legal recourse against suppliers of dangerous products
within the EC from mid-1994, under a general product safety directive
approved into law by EC ministers this week, writes David Buchan in
Brussels.
The measure is designed to give consumers a right of recourse in sectors not
covered by specific EC-wide safety legislation. It leaves member states
responsible for monitoring safety and dealing with complaints, but provides
a fast alert system.
