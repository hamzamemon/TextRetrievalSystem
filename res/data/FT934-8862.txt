Sicilian magistrates said yesterday that bosses of the Mafia's Corleone clan
killed anti-Mafia judge Giovanni Falcone, his wife and three bodyguards in
May 1992, Reuter reports from Rome.
After sophisticated detective work, including DNA testing of saliva found on
discarded cigarette butts, they issued 18 arrest warrants for the car
bombing which outraged Italy.
