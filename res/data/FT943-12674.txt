Argyll, the UK's third-largest grocery retailer, has replaced Warburg
Securities with BZW as its stockbroker. BZW will be joint brokers with
Panmure Gordon. No reason was given for the move. Argyll, however, has long
been thought to be not entirely comfortable about Warburg also being broker
to J Sainsbury.
