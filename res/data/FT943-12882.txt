UK broadcasters are launching a trial of a system which will make television
programmes more accessible to people with sight problems.
Over the next four months, a number of programmes on ITV and the BBC will be
broadcast with a data signal carrying an audio commentary describing what
happens in the programme during gaps in the dialogue.
The Audetel system uses set-top receivers which transmit the commentary
through headphones or a loudspeaker.
The system was primarily developed to give people with sight problems
greater access to television but it is also intended to appeal to other
viewers who want to follow a programme while doing something else.
The system has been developed by a consortium including the Age &amp; Cognitive
Research Centre at Manchester University, BBC, ITC, ITV Association,
Motorola and the Royal National Institute for the Blind.
