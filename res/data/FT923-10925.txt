Wardle Storeys, the plastics and safety equipment group, has acquired
machinery from a Spanish PVC-coated fabrics manufacturer which had ceased
production.
Wardle has paid about Pounds 1m for the plant which will be installed in the
Earby factory of its technical products arm.
Mr Brian Lees, managing director of the division, said the acquisition would
lead to improved production efficiencies and an improved range of products.
