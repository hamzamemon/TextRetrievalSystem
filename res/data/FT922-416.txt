Railway employees in the US were returning to work yesterday, after Congress
passed legislation late on Thursday which effectively ended the shutdown of

provided for an immediate cooling-off period in the dispute, followed by
binding arbitration if no settlement is reached in negotiations between rail
unions and management.
