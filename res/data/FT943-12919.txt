A further 17 schools have won approval to become Technology Colleges, the
government announced yesterday.
They will receive cash from the Department for Education to augment
sponsorship committed by local businesses to help them develop specialist
science and technology teaching. The approvals will bring technology
colleges in operation by September to 42.
