The Treuhand privatisation agency yesterday agreed to provide a fresh
financing package for Eko Stahl, eastern Germany's loss-making steel mill,
until the end of the year. However Mr Wolf Schode, spokesman for the agency,
confirmed it was hoping to sell the mill in the autumn, after Riva, the
privately-owned Italian steel manufacturer, pulled out of a contract to buy
Eko Stahl in May. Mr Schode said Eko Stahl would receive DM50m (Pounds
20.6m) to cover losses, adding that the European Commission had already been
told and he was 'not pessimistic' that the grant would be accepted by
Brussels. The Commission last month started proceedings concerning the
legality of state aid to Eko Stahl.
