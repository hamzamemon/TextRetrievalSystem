Algeria's conference for National Reconciliation has ended without naming a
president to replace the five-man High State Council which has ruled the
country since the suspension of elections two years ago, writes Francis
Ghiles in London.
The meeting was boycotted by Algeria's main political parties, including the
lay Front des Forces Socialistes, led by Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, and the former
ruling Front de Liberation National Party. Both urged Algerian leaders to
open negotiations with the banned Islamic Salvation Front which was poised
for victory at the polls two years ago.
