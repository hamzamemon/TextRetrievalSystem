PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori of Peru yesterday said municipal elections
scheduled for November would now be held in February, Reuter reports from
Lima. He had already called elections for November 22 to choose a congress
to write a new constitution. But politicians refused to take part in
preparatory talks until a date had been set for municipal elections.
