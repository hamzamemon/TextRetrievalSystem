The strong performance of the oil majors is likely to continue on Thursday
when Royal Dutch Petroleum and Shell Transport and Trading report third
quarter results. Analysts expect profits on a current cost basis, excluding
stock losses and gains, to be around Pounds 900m, although some estimates
are close to Pounds 1bn.
