UMBRO Europe, the sportswear manufacturer that makes the England football
strip, announced that it was to cut more than 170 jobs, closing its
factories at Macclesfield, Cheshire, and Stockport, Greater Manchester. The
company relies on exclusive deals with football clubs. It struck the biggest
English kit sponsorship deal in June when it agreed to pay Manchester United
Pounds 9.6m over six years.
