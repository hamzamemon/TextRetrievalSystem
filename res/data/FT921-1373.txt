AMERICAN EXPRESS and American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T), two corporate
giants under pressure from nimble rivals, have joined forces in an attempt
to woo the US small business community.
They announced yesterday that AT&amp;T's corporate calling card and the American
Express corporate charge card would be jointly marketed to small businesses
as a single entity.
The system will allow small businesses which are American Express corporate
card members to charge AT&amp;T telecommunications expenses along with other
out-of-office expenses and get a single monthly statement.
American Express is under pressure from the Visa and Mastercard credit card
operations.
