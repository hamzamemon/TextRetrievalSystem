The Trade Practices Commission, Australia's competition watchdog, is to
investigate the arrangements by which Australian Gas Light is permitted to
haul natural gas from the Cooper Basin in South Australia to
heavily-populated east coast areas, writes Nikki Tait.
The company is a quoted utility and the country's largest natural gas
pipeline company.
The TPC said it would draw on a separate Industry Commission study, to be
completed by December 14, which will look at changes in gas industry
operations.
