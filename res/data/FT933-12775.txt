WATERGLADE International and its associates have withdrawn their requisition
to Seafield, the Dublin-based transport and property group, to hold an
extraordinary meeting to replace the entire current board with executive
directors of Waterglade.
Mr Brian Chilver, chairman of Seafield, said 'Waterglade's decision to
cancel their move is most welcome. We can now get on with running the
company for the benefit of all shareholders.'
