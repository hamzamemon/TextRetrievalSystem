At least 28 people were injured on Saturday as Pakistani troops opened fire
to stop thousands of Kashmiris agitating for an independent state from
crossing the border into India, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi. Mr
Amanullah Khan, leader of the march and chief of the militant Jammu and
Kashmir Liberation Front, was arrested.
