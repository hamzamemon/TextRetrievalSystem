The worst individual performance from any of the FT-SE 100 stocks came from
Sun Alliance, the composite insurance company, which closed 20, or 5.2 per
cent, down at 367p, having touched 361p at one point, after the group
announced a disappointing net asset value figure for the half year along
with its interim results.
Sun Alliance shares approached their all-time high of 398p, reached in March
1991, last week, shrugging aside recent market rumours that the insurer's
interims could be accompanied by a sizeable rights issue.
However, dealers said the slide in the share price was not accompanied by
any great volume of selling pressure. Turnover in Sun Alliance was 3.1m.
The company's profits figures were above most market expectations, but
dealers expressed concern about the reduction in the group's solvency ratio,
from 54 per cent to 50 per cent. The proposed Pounds 300m preference share
issue 'removes the threat of a big cash call on shareholders', said an
analyst.
