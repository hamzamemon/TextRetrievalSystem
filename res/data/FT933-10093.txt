Seven economics professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who
called last week for the end of the European exchange rate mechanism say the
decision to widen the currency fluctuation bands to 15 per cent was 'sound
and pragmatic'. In today's Financial Times, they write: 'The speculators
were the best friends of the unemployed . . . Rather than look back and
dream of punishing speculators, officials need now to exploit the new-found
freedom to fight unemployment . . . giving urgent priority to expansion.'
