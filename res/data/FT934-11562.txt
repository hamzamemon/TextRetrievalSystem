The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society is launching a repayment
mortgage which includes free life cover and has a variable rate of 7.99 per
cent. The Freelife Mortgage will not be available to everyone. Applicants
must answer questions about their health and those excluded will include
those with a heart condition, who have tested positive for HIV, and who have
had treatment for some other problems (such as a stroke) over the past 12
months. Those who have been refused life cover before will also be excluded.
Freelife is available on mortgages of up to Pounds 250,000. Borrowers will
need a deposit of 10 per cent.
