MUNICIPAL Mutual Insurance, the stricken local-authority insurer, sold its
computer services division, MMC, to CFM Group, a Marlow-based facilities
management company, yesterday.
The deal was originally agreed in July. CFM will pay more than Pounds 1m to
acquire MMC, employing about 60 of the company's 70 staff. MMC managed
computer facilities for five local authorities.
