MR John Redwood, the local government minister, yesterday emphasised that
local councils have the power to to reduce or remit rate bills in hardship
cases.
His reference to the ability to cut a bill follows a decision by Test Valley
council to give their officers power to approve reductions.
The measure to improve the business rate transitional relief scheme,
announced in the Budget, will begin its passage through the Commons today.
