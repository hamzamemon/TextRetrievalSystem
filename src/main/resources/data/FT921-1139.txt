Violence erupted outside the Turkish embassy in Belgrave Square, central
London, when 200 people protesting at the recent fighting between Kurds and
security forces in south-eastern Turkey clashed with police.
One demonstrator suffered serious head injuries, 20 were arrested, and a
policeman was treated for broken fingers. The Police Complaints Authority
said an official inquiry would be held into the incident.
Eight people were arrested when they demonstrated at the BBC World Service
headquarters in Aldwych.
