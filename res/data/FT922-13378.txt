A bomb exploded in the suburbs of the Sri Lankan capital Colombo last night,
killing at least 10 people and injuring 35, Reuter reports from Colombo.
Police said they suspected the separatist Tamil Tigers placed the bomb in a
parked car. Earlier at least 45 people were killed by a bomb on a bus and in
two ambushes in eastern Sri Lanka yesterday. The authorities again blamed
Tamil separatists.
