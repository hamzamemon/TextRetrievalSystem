DONINGTON Park, the Leicestershire motor racing circuit, is to stage its
first grand prix since 1938. FISA, the world governing body of motor sports,
has revived the concept of a European Grand Prix and it will be at Donington
on April 11. Silverstone will retain the British Grand Prix, held in July.
