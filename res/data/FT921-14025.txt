A group of Wellcome shareholders will try to freeze dividend payments and
force down the price of Retrovir, the Aids treatment, at the company's
annual meeting today, writes Daniel Green.
The Wellcome Independent Shareholders Association (Wisa) conceded that it
would not succeed but that 'in future they may lower the price.'
Wisa has 'about 60' members, all small shareholders.
It has links with shareholders in other countries including the US, where a
well-established Aids lobby has been campaigning for several years to reduce
the price of the drug.
