Sugar prices are likely to stay in their current consolidation phase with
big importers such as China and Russia staying away until well into next
year, according to broker C. Czarnikow.
In its month Sugar Review Czarnikow said: 'Although renewed strength may
well emerge during the course of next year, there is now less certainty
about the direction which the market might take in the short-term and there
is likely to be a period of consolidation'.
The recent rise in sugar prices had taken place earlier than might have been
expected, it added.
