Sir Christopher Lewinton, chairman of TI Group, was last year paid a Pounds
110,000 performance-related bonus as the company saw pre-tax profits
increase 43 per cent.
The bonus, on top of a Pounds 50,000 increase in basic salary to Pounds
558,000 and Pounds 37,000 benefits-in-kind, took Sir Christopher's total
package to Pounds 705,000, excluding pension contributions of Pounds 35,000.
