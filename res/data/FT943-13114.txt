The Spanish government yesterday evening defused a political row with France
by handing over La Gabrielle, the hijacked tuna trawler, to the French
authorities. La Gabrielle had been held since last weekend by Spanish
fishermen after violent clashes with their French counterparts over the size
of the French trawler's tuna nets. France has since the start of the week
been pressing for the return of La Gabrielle. Mr Edouard Balladur, the
French prime minister, stepped up the diplomatic pressure by calling at
yesterday's cabinet meeting for the 'immediate return' of the vessel and
stressing that his government would press for 'compensation' for its owners.
However a Spanish official, who boarded La Gabrielle on Tuesday, reported
that its tuna nets were twice the maximum size of 2.5km permitted under
European Union regulations. The Spanish authorities yesterday afternoon
persuaded the hijackers to surrender La Gabrielle to them, but stressed that
Spain would continue to lobby for the application of EU fishing regulations
even after returning the trawler to French hands.
