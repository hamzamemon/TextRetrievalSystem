THE European Community has awarded Credit Lyonnais of France the mandate to
lead manage a Ecu500m (Dollars 363m) three-year loan, marking the first time
the EC has tapped the international syndicated-loans market in a decade.
The EC has agreed to pay a margin of 3.125 basis points - that is 1/32 of a
percentage point - over the London interbank offered rate (Libor), with
participation fees of 10 basis points. Although the terms appear tight, the
EC is able to borrow at very low margins in the international loans market.
