Sir, Ms Balsom (Letters, July 20) is absolutely right about rip-off prices
for products in Britain. However, this only touches the surface. The cost of
so-called professional services such as the law and accountancy is nothing
less than a scandal.
This problem derives from attitudes at the very heart of the City of London.
My UK bank recently wrote to me explaining that charges would rise in 'order
to contain rising costs'. Am I losing my facility in British English - or
just my sense of humour?
