THE CANADIAN province of Nova Scotia expects to raise CDollars 400m by
privatising Nova Scotia Power Corporation, the provincial power utility,
writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
The government said yesterday it planned to offer shares in NS Power by the
end of June. No single shareholder would be allowed to own more than 10 per
cent of the shares, and foreign investors as a group would be limited to a
25 per cent stake.
NS Power earned CDollars 24m net income in the last fiscal year from
revenues of CDollars 636m.
