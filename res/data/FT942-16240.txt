Gibraltar's financial services will adhere to UK standards following an
agreement between the two governments. Gibraltar's Financial Services
Commission, the industry regulator, will be appointed by and accountable to
the British government, thereby enabling the UK to meet its EU
responsibilities. It will operate independently of both governments. Spain
has expressed doubts about allowing a separate licensing authority in
Gibraltar, which is part of the EU as a European territory for whose
external relations the UK is responsible.
