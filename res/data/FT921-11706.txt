HUNGARY intends to apply formally this spring to join the European
Community, Mr Mihaly Kupa, the finance minister, said yesterday during a
visit to Stockholm, Robert Taylor reports.
'Our ambition is to negotiate alongside Sweden and Austria and become an EC
member by 1996 at the latest,' he said.
It is unlikely the Commission will treat Hungary's request seriously.
Brussels does not see EC membership for Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia
before 2000.
