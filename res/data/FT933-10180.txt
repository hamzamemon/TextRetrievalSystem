HODDER HEADLINE, the independent publishing company, has made 72 members of
its UK staff redundant under a reorganisation following the takeover of
Hodder &amp; Stoughton by Headline in June.
Further redundancies and a relocation will follow next spring when Hodder's
old distribution centre near Sevenoaks in Kent is closed.
About 150 employees there will be affected.
Headline's existing distribution company, Bookpoint in Abingdon, Berkshire,
will be expanded and an extra 70 people will be taken on.
Mr Tim Hely Hutchinson, group chief executive, said yesterday he expected a
net reduction in UK staff of 152 people.
'The great majority of these redundancies relate to the group's
administrative functions. The commissioning editorial teams are virtually
unaffected and there will be additional recruitment on the creative side of
the business.'
Because of redundancy and reorganisation costs a loss is possible this year,
but the company is then expected to perform strongly.
Mr Hely Hutchinson, who founded Headline, said yesterday the backlist of the
125-year old Hodder &amp; Stoughton had turned out to be stronger than expected.
