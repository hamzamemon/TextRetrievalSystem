Marks and Spencer, the food and clothing retailer, is to open 25 stores
regularly on Sundays after Sunday trading becomes legal next month. All its
stores will open on Sunday in December.
In Scotland, where Sunday trading is already legal, the number of stores
opening will rise from two to five. Staff working on Sundays will receive
double pay.
