Italy's rate of inflation is still falling, despite the devaluation of the
lira in September, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
According to preliminary figures for December based on evidence from the
country's main cities, inflation is running at an annual rate of 4.7 per
cent, the lowest level since October 1988.
Prices this month have risen 0.1 per cent, forcing the annual average down
from November's 4.9 per cent.
