Finsbury Smaller Companies investment trust is planning to raise an extra
Pounds 15m with a C-share issue. Some Pounds 10m of that is likely to come
from a placing with institutions, but Pounds 5m will be available to the
public. The Pounds 35m, split-capital fund invests in UK smaller companies,
and is fully Pep qualifying. The closing date for the offer is November 8,
and SG Warburg is broker to the issue.
