PICT Petroleum, the oil and gas exploration and production group, has sold
its equity stakes in three oil companies, Croft Oil &amp; Gas, Edinburgh Oil &amp;
Gas and Tullow Oil.
The total price realised of Pounds 1.44m was close to book value. The
company said the proceeds would be added to reserves.
The Edinburgh Oil and Tullow stakes were acquired in 1989 and 1990 as part
of the sale proceeds arising from Pict's withdrawal from onshore UK
exploration and production. The Croft shares were acquired in 1992 as part
payment for the sale of its interest in the Claymore field.
Pict has now sold all its equity interests in non-affiliated oil and gas
companies.
