Sir, Professor Wynne Godley and Mr William Milberg (Letters, July 18) appear
to overlook the simple fact that the US's foreign indebtedness will continue
to rise as long as its domestic saving is insufficient to match its domestic
investment. The US's trade problem (if there is one) lies in the country's
low propensity to save, not in an overvalued exchange rate.
