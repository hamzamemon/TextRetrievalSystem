Maple Leaf Inns, a joint venture company launched last month by Labatt, the
Canadian brewer, and Pubmaster, the Brent Walker subsidiary, has bought 18
public houses in the north west of England from Bass for an undisclosed
amount.
Mr John Brackenbury, chairman of Maple Leaf, said further acquisitions were
expected in the next three months. The company intended to expand its estate
to a total of 1,000 pubs nationally.
