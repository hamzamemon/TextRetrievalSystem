DAILY MIRROR journalists will picket MGN's headquarters today in an attempt
to disrupt production of two Sunday newspapers, the Sunday Mirror and The
People.
The journalists protested outside the London headquarters of Mirror Group
Newspapers yesterday to try to bring about the reinstatement of 100 sacked
colleagues.
More than 100 freelance journalists, many of whom have worked on various MGN
titles for years, have been locked out of the building since Monday.
