Olympia &amp; York should have been required to enter into a contractual
commitment to pay by a specified date its Pounds 400m cash contribution to
the cost of extending the Jubilee Line to its Canary Wharf office
development, Mr Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat MP for Southwark and
Bermondsey maintained in the Commons last night.
He gave notice that he would call for an inquiry by the Parliamentary
Ombudsman to determine whether the government had been guilty of
maladministration in leaving 'to chance' the multi-billion pound scheme.
