King &amp; Shaxson Holdings, the discount house, said that for the six months to
October 31 it had made 'excellent profits' as opposed to a small profit last
time.
Accordingly, the interim dividend is lifted from 2.5p to 4p.
Included in the results are those of wholly-owned Smith St Aubyn (Holdings),
the discount house.
