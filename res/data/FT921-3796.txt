scheme for the scheduled services of UK airlines which go out of business
was announced yesterday by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary.
He said it would be financed by a small levy on airlines which would work
out at no more than Pounds 1 a passenger.
Until now, passengers on scheduled flights have not been covered against
airline collapse as package holidaymakers are.
