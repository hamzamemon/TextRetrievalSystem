BRITISH RAIL confirmed yesterday that a Pounds 140m order for 47 four-car
Networker trains for its Network SouthEast division would go to Brel,
Britain's biggest trainmaker, thereby helping to safeguard 1,500 jobs in
York.
The order had long been halted by lack of funds, but the government
announced during the election campaign that it was allowing BR to go ahead
with the order.
