International Distillers &amp; Vintners, Grand Metropolitan's drinks division,
is forming a joint venture with Hanschell Inniss, a Barbados-based wines and
spirits distributor.
The partnership will distribute brands of both companies in eastern
Caribbean markets.
IDV will also acquire a 50 per cent interest in the Cockspur rum trademark
from Hanschell Inniss and, in co-operation with the company, manage the
international development of the brand.
Mr Howard Smith, president of IDV Africa and Latin America, said yesterday:
'The new partnership will greatly increase the focus on IDV's brands and
accelerate the pace of their development'.
