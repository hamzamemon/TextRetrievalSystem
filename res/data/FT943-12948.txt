The Thai government is considering allowing more hot and cold-rolled coil
steel makers into Thailand, despite an agreement to preserve Sahaviriya
Steel Industries' monopoly until 1999, AP-DJ reports from Bangkok.
The Thai Board of Investment was supposed to have decided this week whether
to rescind Sahaviriya's protection, but it deferred the decision until next
month.
