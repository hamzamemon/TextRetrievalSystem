CHANNEL 4 was prevented from showing a programme on the City last night
after the Department of Trade and Industry was granted an injunction.
The DTI moved to prevent the second programme in the series Greed and Glory
disclosing details of the unpublished investigation into the Guinness
affair. Channel 4 said last night it would try to get the injunction lifted
and show the programme next Sunday.
