ASDA, THE troubled grocery chain, has declared 500 management jobs redundant
at its 206 stores. The Leeds-based company plans to limit job losses by
redeploying some staff. The move follows the loss of 350 jobs at Asda's
headquarters in January.
The company said the latest cuts reflected the cost benefits from
centralised distribution.
