A call to GCHQ, the British government's multi-million pound nerve-centre
equipped with every state of the art gizmo for listening into the mass of
telephone traffic buzzing in and out of the UK, elicited an apologetic
response from the duty officer. 'I'm sorry,' he said, explaining why an
earlier call had not been answered, 'our man was trying to get back to you
but his phone wouldn't work.'
